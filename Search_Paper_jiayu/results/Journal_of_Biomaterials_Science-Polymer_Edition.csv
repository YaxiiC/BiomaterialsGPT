39259660,Robust tissue adhesion in biomedical applications: enhancing polymer stability in an injectable protein-based hydrogel.,"Protein-based hydrogels are appealing materials for a variety of therapeutic uses because they are compatible, biodegradable, and adaptable to biological and chemical changes. Therefore, adherent varieties of hydrogels have received significant study; nevertheless, the majority of them show weak mechanical characteristics, transient adherence, poor biocompatibility activity, and low tensile strength. Here we are reporting, a two-component (BSA-gelatin) protein solution crosslinked with Tetrakis (hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride (THPC) to form a novel hydrogel. Compared with classical adhesive hydrogels, this hydrogel showed enhanced mechanical properties, was biocompatible with L929 cells, and had minimal invasive injectability. A considerable, high tensile strength of 73.33 +/- 11.54 KPa and faultless compressive mechanical properties of 173 KPa at 75% strain were both demonstrated by this adhesive hydrogel. Moreover, this maximum tissue adhesion strength could reach 18.29 +/- 2.22 kPa, significantly higher than fibrin glue. Cell viability was 97.09 +/- 6.07%, which indicated that these hydrogels were non-toxic to L929. The fastest gelation time of the BSA-gelatin hydrogel was 1.25 +/- 0.17 min at physiological pH and 37  degrees C. Therefore, the obtained novel work can potentially serve as a tissue adhesive hydrogel in the field of biomedical industries.",Journal of biomaterials science.

31443620,Study of a cross-linked hydrogel of Karaya gum and Starch as a controlled drug delivery system.,A cross-linked hydrogel was synthesized using a hybrid backbone of karaya gum starch and grafted with polyacrylic acid. It showed a maximum swelling ratio (SR) of 30.5 g/g at pH 10 and was explored as an oral drug delivery carrier using paracetamol and aspirin as model drugs. In vitro release experiments revealed that maximum drug release at pH 7.4 in comparison to pH 1.2 (simulated intestinal vs gastric fluid) and neutral medium. The release profiles of these drugs showed no initial burst. It also showed good hemocompatibilty and non-cytotoxicity for its employment as a site specific drug delivery agent.,Journal of biomaterials science.

29609508,Dynamical release nanospheres containing cell growth factor from biopolymer hydrogel via reversible covalent conjugation.,"For practical adipose regeneration, the challenge is to dynamically deliver the key adipogenic insulin-like growth factors in hydrogels to induce adipogenesis. In order to achieve dynamic release, smart hydrogels to sense the change in the blood glucose concentration is required when glucose concentration increases. In this study, a heparin-based hydrogel has been developed for use in dynamic delivery of heparin nanospheres containing insulin-like growth factor. The gel scaffold was facilely prepared in physiological conditions by the formation of boronate-maltose ester cross-links between boronate and maltose groups of heparin derivatives. Due to its intrinsic glucose-sensitivity, the exposure of gel scaffold to glucose induces maltose functionalized nanospheres dissociation off hydrogel network and thereby could dynamically move into the microenvironment. The potential of the hydrogel as a cell scaffold was demonstrated by encapsulation of human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) within the gel matrix in vitro. Cell culture showed that this dynamic hydrogel could support survival and proliferation of ASCs. This biocompatible coupling chemistry has the advantage that it introduces no potentially cytotoxic groups into injectable gel scaffolds formed and can create a more biomimetic microenvironment for drug and cell delivery, rendering them more suitable for potential in vivo biomedical applications. All these results indicate that this biocompatible gel scaffold can render the formulation of a therapeutically effective platform for diabetes treatment and adipose regeneration.",Journal of biomaterials science.

27659945,Fabrication of dual-sensitive keratin-based polymer hydrogels and their controllable release behaviors.,"Using feather keratin (FK) as a biocompatible and inexpensive biopolymer, a kind of dual-sensitive keratin-based polymer hydrogel (FK/PNiPA/PIAc-Gel) with interpenetrating network structure was prepared by two-step polymerization of N-isopropyl acrylamide (NiPA) and itaconic acid (IAc) in presence of crosslinker. After being characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy, its swelling behaviors and environmental sensitivity were investigated. The obtained biopolymer based hydrogel has good swelling and deswelling performance, and it is sensitive to pH value, temperature and salts of environment. Using anticancer drug, doxorubicin hydrochloride (Dox.HCl),  and Bovine serum albumin (BSA) as different drug molecules, its release behaviors in different environment were investigated. It was found that the release behaviors of FK/PNiPA/PIAc-Gel were controllable via adjusting pH value or temperature of environment. The cumulative release of the anticancer drug (Dox.HCl) reached 93.3% within 16 h, and the cumulative release rate of macromolecular drug (BSA) got to 75.9% in 24 h. In summary, the keratin-based biopolymer hydrogel with interpenetrating network structure, pH-sensitivity and temperature sensitivity are potentially applied to sustain drug carrier and humid medicinal material in the biomedical field or clinical nursing field.",Journal of biomaterials science.
