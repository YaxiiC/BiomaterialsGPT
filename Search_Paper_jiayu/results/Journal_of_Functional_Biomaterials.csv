39452585,Antibacterial Biocomposite Based on Chitosan/Pluronic/Agarose Noncovalent Hydrogel: Controlled Drug Delivery by Alginate/Tetracycline Beads System.,"Designing a wound dressing with controlled uptake, antibacterial, and proper biocompatibility is crucial for the appropriate wound healing process. In this study, alginate/tetracycline (Alg/TC) beads were produced and embedded into chitosan/pluronic/agarose semi-interpenetrating polymer network hydrogel, which serves as a potential biocompatible dressing for treating skin wounds. The effect of pluronic content on the porosity, swelling, mechanical characteristics, and degradation of the hydrogel was investigated. Furthermore, the impact of Alg beads on TC release was subsequently examined. In the absence of Alg beads, faster release was observed. However, after incorporating beads into the hydrogels, the release was sustained. Particularly, the hydrogel containing Alg beads exhibited a nearly linear release, reaching 74% after 2 days in acidic media. The antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility of the hydrogel were also evaluated to assess the capability of the TC-loaded hydrogels for wound dressing applications. The hydrogel demonstrated efficient antibacterial features against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, the sample behavior was evaluated against exposure to yeast. Furthermore, based on biocompatibility studies using HFF2 cells, the TC-loaded hydrogel exhibited remarkable biocompatibility. Overall, this novel composite hydrogel shows remarkable biocompatibility and antibacterial activities which can be used as a great potential wound dressing to prevent wound infections due to its effective inhibition of bacterial growth.",Journal of functional biomaterials,2024 Sep 28,Journal Article,10.3390/jfb15100286,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39452585/,
38667562,Strontium-Doped Bioglass-Laden Gelatin Methacryloyl Hydrogels for Vital Pulp Therapy.,"This study aimed to develop gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-injectable hydrogels incorporated with 58S bioactive glass/BG-doped with strontium for vital pulp therapy applications. GelMA hydrogels containing 0% (control), 5%, 10%, and 20% BG (w/v) were prepared. Their morphological and chemical properties were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy/SEM, energy dispersive spectroscopy/EDS, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy/FTIR (n = 3). Their swelling capacity and degradation ratio were also measured (n = 4). Cell viability (n = 8), mineralized matrix formation, cell adhesion, and spreading (n = 6) on DPSCs were evaluated. Data were analyzed using ANOVA/post hoc tests (alpha = 5%). SEM and EDS characterization confirmed the incorporation of BG particles into the hydrogel matrix, showing GelMA's (C, O) and BG's (Si, Cl, Na, Sr) chemical elements. FTIR revealed the main chemical groups of GelMA and BG, as ~1000 cm(-1) corresponds to Si-O and ~1440 cm(-1) to C-H. All the formulations were degraded by day 12, with a lower degradation ratio observed for GelMA+BG20%. Increasing the concentration of BG resulted in a lower mass swelling ratio. Biologically, all the groups were compatible with cells (p > 0.6196), and cell adhesion increased over time, irrespective of BG concentration, indicating great biocompatibility. GelMA+BG5% demonstrated a higher deposition of mineral nodules over 21 days (p < 0.0001), evidencing the osteogenic potential of hydrogels. GelMA hydrogels incorporated with BG present great cytocompatibility, support cell adhesion, and have a clinically relevant degradation profile and suitable mineralization potential, supporting their therapeutic potential as promising biomaterials for pulp capping.",Journal of functional biomaterials,2024 Apr 17,Journal Article,10.3390/jfb15040105,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38667562/,
25859630,"Development of thermosensitive hydrogels of chitosan, sodium and magnesium glycerophosphate for bone regeneration applications.","Thermosensitive injectable hydrogels based on chitosan neutralized with sodium beta-glycerophosphate (Na-beta-GP) have been studied as biomaterials for drug delivery and tissue regeneration. Magnesium (Mg) has been reported to stimulate adhesion and proliferation of bone forming cells. With the aim of improving the suitability of the aforementioned chitosan hydrogels as materials for bone regeneration, Mg was incorporated by partial substitution of Na-beta-GP with magnesium glycerophosphate (Mg-GP). Chitosan/Na-beta-GP and chitosan/Na-beta-GP/Mg-GP hydrogels were also loaded with the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (ALP) which induces hydrogel mineralization. Hydrogels were characterized physicochemically with respect to mineralizability and gelation kinetics, and biologically with respect to cytocompatibility and cell adhesion. Substitution of Na-beta-GP with Mg-GP did not negatively influence mineralizability. Cell biological testing showed that both chitosan/Na-beta-GP and chitosan/Na-beta-GP/Mg-GP hydrogels were cytocompatible towards MG63 osteoblast-like cells. Hence, chitosan/Na-beta-GP/Mg-GP hydrogels can be used as an alternative to chitosan/Na-beta-GP hydrogels for bone regeneration applications. However the incorporation of Mg in the hydrogels during hydrogel formation did not bring any appreciable physicochemical or biological benefit.",Journal of functional biomaterials,2015 Apr 9,Journal Article,10.3390/jfb6020192,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25859630/,
