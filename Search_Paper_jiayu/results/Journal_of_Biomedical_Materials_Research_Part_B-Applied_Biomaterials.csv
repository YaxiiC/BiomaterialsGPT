35099106,Biocompatible polymeric blend for pH driven delivery of cytarabine: Effect of feed contents on swelling and release kinetics.,"Purpose of this study was to prepare chitosan/tamarind crosslinked poly (methacrylic acid) hydrogels for pH responsive delivery of cytarabine by using aqueous free radical polymerization technique. Polymers were chemically cross-linked with monomer (methacrylic acid) using methylene bisacrylamide as cross-linking agent and ammonium per sulphate as a reaction initiator in aqueous medium. Developed hydrogels were characterized for morphology, physical existence, drug loading (%), compositional and structural analysis, thermal behavior and stability, drug release analysis (pH 1.2 and pH 7.4), and in vivo release kinetics. pH sensitive behavior was established by observing swelling and release behavior at different pH values (1.2 and 7.4). Biocompatibility of network was evaluated through acute oral toxicity studies in rabbits. Results revealed that cytarabine was efficiently loaded in prepared hydrogels with an entrapment efficiency of 54.67%-108.59%. Highest swelling ratio of 38.67 was noticed at pH 7.4. Maximum pH sensitive behavior was seen at pH 7.4 showing maximum drug release up to 94.51%. All developed formulations followed zero order release as confirmed from regression coefficient (R(2)  = 0.9912-0.9991). In-vivo studies confirmed enhanced bioavailability of cytarabine. Histopathological examination and hemocompatibility studies proved that developed hydrogel system was safe, biocompatible, nonhemolytic in nature exhibiting no symptoms of dermal, ocular toxicities, and no changes in biochemical parameters of blood and histology of key organs. So, developed hydrogel system can be employed as an excellent drug delivery device where controlled drug delivery is desired.","Journal of biomedical materials research.

24142904,The beneficial effect of encapsulated human adipose-derived stem cells in alginate hydrogel on neural differentiation.,"Tissue engineering employs combination of biomaterials and cell therapy to develop new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases, spinal cord, and traumatic brain injuries. Alginate is a biocompatible hydrogel, which has been used broadly to encapsulate many types of cells. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) have appropriate property to differentiate into neuron-like cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of alginate hydrogel on the viability and neural differentiation potential of induced hADSCs. After neural induction of isolated hADSCs and encapsulated in alginate hydrogel, the cell viability using MTT assay and their neural differentiation potential by immunocytochemical and real time RT-PCR analysis for neural markers (Nestin, GFAP, and MAP2) were evaluated. Expression of Nestin, GFAP, and MAP2 markers was significantly increased compare to monolayer induced cells (p<0.001), but we did not found any significant effect on viability of induced cells relative to monolayer induced cells. Although neural differentiation of encapsulated cells was increased relative to monolayer induced cells, the viability of these cells was not significantly different in alginate hydrogel as compared with monolayer induced cells.","Journal of biomedical materials research.
