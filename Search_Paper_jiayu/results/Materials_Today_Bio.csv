39759845,Hyaluronidase-responsive hydrogel loaded with magnetic nanoparticles combined with external magnetic stimulation for spinal cord injury repair.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a neurological condition that causes significant loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions below the level of injury. Current clinical treatment strategies often fail to meet expectations. Hyaluronidase is typically associated with tumor progression and bacterial infections. Analysis showed that hyaluronidase also persistently increased in a rat total excision model. In this study, we designed a highly biocompatible dual-responsive hydrogel. Hyaluronic acid (HA)-Gelatin (Gel) served as the base for the hydrogel, crosslinked via an amide reaction to form the hydrogel. The hydrogel was further combined with Neurotrophic growth factor (NGF) and Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles, exhibiting low toxicity, good mechanical properties, self-healing ability, and sustained drug release. In cellular experiments, the novel hydrogel significantly promoted neural axon growth and development under an external magnetic field. Therapeutic results were confirmed in a rat spinal cord resection model, where inflammation was reduced, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans decreased and a favorable environment for nerve regeneration was provided; neural regeneration improved hind limb motor function in SCI rats. These results underscore the therapeutic potential of hydrogel.",Materials today. Bio,2025 Feb,Journal Article,10.1016/j.mtbio.2024.101378,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39759845/,
38706729,"NIR-Responsive injectable hydrogel cross-linked by homobifunctional PEG for photo-hyperthermia of melanoma, antibacterial wound healing, and preventing post-operative adhesion.","Current therapeutic approaches for skin cancer face significant challenges, including wound infection, delayed skin regeneration, and tumor recurrence. To overcome these challenges, an injectable adhesive near-infrared (NIR)-responsive hydrogel with time-dependent enhancement in viscosity is developed for combined melanoma therapy and antibacterial wound healing acceleration. The multifunctional hydrogel is prepared through the chemical crosslinking between poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic acid) and gelatin, followed by the incorporation of CuO nanosheets and allantoin. The synergistic inherent antibacterial potential of CuO nanosheets, the regenerative and smoothing effect of allantoin, the extracellular matrix-mimicking effect of gelatin, and the desirable swelling behavior of the hydrogel results in fast wound recovery after photothermal ablation of the tumor. Additionally, the hydrogel can serve as an alternative to sutures owing to its tissue adhesiveness ability, which can further render it the merits for accelerated repair of abdominal lesions while acting as a biocompatible barrier to prevent peritoneal adhesion.",Materials today.

38390343,Cubosome-carrying bacterial cellulose membrane as a versatile drug delivery platform.,"Using advanced nanotechnology membranes has opened up new possibilities in the field of biomedicine, particularly for controlled drug delivery and especially for topical use. Bacterial cellulose membranes (BCM), particularly, have gained prominence owing to their distinctive attributes, including remarkable water retention, safety, biodegradability, and tunable gas exchange. However, they are aqueous matrices and, for this reason, of limited capacity for incorporation of apolar compounds. Cubosomes are lipid nanoparticles composed of a surfactant bicontinuous reverse cubic phase, which, owing to their bicontinuous structure, can incorporate both polar and apolar compounds. Therefore, these particles present a promising avenue for encapsulating and releasing drugs and biomolecules due to their superior entrapment efficiency. In this study, we aim to extend earlier investigations using polymeric hydrogels for cubosome immobilization, now using BCMs, a more resilient biocompatible matrix. Phytantriol cubosome-loaded BCMs were prepared by three distinct protocols: ex situ incorporation into wet BCMs, ex situ incorporation by swelling of dry BCMs, and an in situ process with the growth of BCMs in a sterile medium already containing cubosomes. Our investigation revealed that these methodologies ensured that cubosomes remained integral, uniformly distributed, and thoroughly dispersed within the membrane, as confirmed using Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and high-resolution confocal microscopy. The effective incorporation and sustained release of diclofenac were validated across the different BCMs and compared with hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel in our previous studies. Furthermore, the resistance against cubosome leaching from the three BCM and HA hydrogel samples was quantitatively evaluated and contrasted. We hope that the outcomes from this research will pave the way for innovative use of this platform in the incorporation and controlled release of varied active agents, amplifying the already multifaceted applicability of BCMs.",Materials today.

37063777,Nanocarriers of shRNA-Runx2 directed to collagen IV as a nanotherapeutic system to target calcific aortic valve disease.,"Runx2 is a key transcription factor involved in valvular interstitial cells (VIC) osteodifferentiation, a process actively entwined with the calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). We hypothesize that a strategy intended to silence Runx2 could be a valuable novel therapeutic option for CAVD. To this intent, we aimed at (i) developing targeted nanoparticles for efficient delivery of short hairpin (sh)RNA sequences specific for Runx2 to the aortic valve employing a relevant mouse model for CAVD and (ii) investigate their therapeutic potential in osteoblast-differentiated VIC (oVIC) cultivated into a 3D scaffold. Since collagen IV was used as a target, a peptide that binds specifically to collagen IV (Cp) was conjugated to the surface of lipopolyplexes encapsulating shRNA-Runx2 (Cp-LPP/shRunx2). The results showed that Cp-LPP/shRunx2 were (i) cytocompatible; (ii) efficiently taken up by 3D-cultured oVIC; (iii) diminished the osteodifferentiation of human VIC (cultured in a 3D hydrogel-derived from native aortic root) by reducing osteogenic molecules expression, alkaline phosphatase activity, and calcium concentration; and (iv) were recruited in aortic valve leaflets in a murine model of atherosclerosis. Taken together, these data recommend Cp-LPP/shRunx2 as a novel targeted nanotherapy to block the progression of CAVD, with a good perspective to be introduced in practical use.",Materials today.

36846309,Human urine-derived stem cell exosomes delivered via injectable GelMA templated hydrogel accelerate bone regeneration.,"The key to critical bone regeneration in tissue engineering relies on an ideal bio-scaffold coated with a controlled release of growth factors. Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and Hyaluronic acid methacrylate (HAMA) have been a novel topic of interest in bone regeneration while introducing appropriate nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAP) to improve its mechanical properties. And the exosomes derived from human urine-derived stem cells (human (USC)EXOs) have also been reported to promote osteogenesis in tissue engineering. The present study aimed to design a new GelMA-HAMA/nHAP composite hydrogel as a drug delivery system. The (USC)EXOs were encapsulated and slow-released in the hydrogel for better osteogenesis. The characterization of the GelMA-based hydrogel showed excellent controlled release performance and appropriate mechanical properties. The in vitro studies showed that the (USC)EXOs/GelMA-HAMA/nHAP composite hydrogel could promote the osteogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the angiogenesis of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), respectively. Meanwhile, the in vivo results confirmed that this composite hydrogel could significantly promote the defect repair of cranial bone in the rat model. In addition, we also found that (USC)EXOs/GelMA-HAMA/nHAP composite hydrogel can promote the formation of H-type vessels in the bone regeneration area, enhancing the therapeutic effect. In conclusion, our findings suggested that this controllable and biocompatible (USC)EXOs/GelMA-HAMA/nHAP composite hydrogel may effectively promote bone regeneration by coupling osteogenesis and angiogenesis.",Materials today.

35637855,PEIGel: A biocompatible and injectable scaffold with innate immune adjuvanticity for synergized local immunotherapy.,"Intratumoral immunotherapeutic hydrogel administration is emerging as an effective method for inducing a durable and robust antitumor immune response. However, scaffold hydrogels that can synergize with the loaded drugs, thus potentiating therapeutic efficacy, are limited. Here, we report a ternary hydrogel composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylenimine (PEI)‒a cationic polymer with potential immunoactivation effects, and magnesium ions‒a stimulator of the adaptive immune response, which exhibits an intrinsic immunomodulation function of reversing the immunologically ""cold"" phenotype of a murine breast tumor to a ""hot"" phenotype by upregulating PD-L1 expression and promoting M1-like macrophage polarization. PEI hydrogel (PEIGel) encapsulating an immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) inhibitor‒anti-PD-L1 antibody (alpha-PDL1) exhibits synergistic effects resulting in elimination of primary tumors and remote metastases and prevention of tumor relapse after surgical resection. A preliminary mechanistic study revealed a probably hidden role of PEI in modulating the polyamine metabolism/catabolism of tumors to potentiate the immune adjuvant effect. These results deepen our understanding of the innate immune activation function of PEI and pave the way for harnessing PEI as an immune adjuvant for ICB therapy.",Materials today.
