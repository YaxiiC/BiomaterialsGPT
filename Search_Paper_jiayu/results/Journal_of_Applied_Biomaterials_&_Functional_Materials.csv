35906767,The fabrication of halloysite nanotube-based multicomponent hydrogel scaffolds for bone healing.,"Bone tissue engineering, as an alternative for common available therapeutic approaches, has been developed to focus on reconstructing of the missing tissues and restoring their functionality. In this work, three-dimensional (3D) nanocomposite scaffolds of polycaprolactone-polyethylene glycol-polycaprolactone/gelatin (PCEC/Gel) were prepared by freeze-drying method. Biocompatible nanohydroxyapatite (nHA), iron oxide nanoparticle (Fe(3)O(4)) and halloysite nanotube (HNT) powders were added to the polymer matrix aiming to combine the osteogenic activity of nHA or Fe(3)O(4) with high mechanical strength of HNT. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) methods was utilized to characterize the nanotube morphology of HNT as well as nanoparticles of Fe(3)O(4) and nHA. Prepared scaffolds were characterized via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), and SEM methods. In addition, the physical behavior of scaffolds was evaluated to explore the influence of HNT on the physicochemical properties of composites. Cell viability and attachment were investigated by MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay and SEM on human dental pulp-derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-DPSCs) in-vitro. Cell proliferation was observed without any cytotoxicity effect on h-DPSCs for all examined scaffolds. Alizarin red (ARS) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining were carried out to determine the osteoconductivity of scaffolds. The data demonstrated that all PCEC/Gel/HNT hydrogel scaffolds supported osteoblast differentiation of hDPSCs with moderate effects on cell proliferation. Moreover, PCEC/Gel/HNT/nHA with proper mechanical strength showed better biological activity compared to PCEC/Gel/HNT/Fe(3)O(4) and PCEC/Gel/HNT scaffolds. Therefore, this study suggested that with proper fillers content, PCEC/Gel/HNT nanocomposite hydrogels alone or in a complex with nHA, Fe(3)O(4) could be a suitable candidate for hard tissue regeneration.",Journal of applied biomaterials & functional materials,2022 Jan-Dec,Journal Article,10.1177/22808000221111875,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35906767/,
31230497,Kinetic investigation of a controlled drug delivery system based on alginate scaffold with embedded voids.,"Alginate scaffold has been used widely for controlled release applications because of its ability to provide three-dimensional supports for formation of a gel matrix. Alginate gel scaffolds for drug delivery matrices were prepared using a fluidic device. N(2) gas was used in the fluidic device to generate bubbles in the gel layer. The hydrogel matrices with induced voids were compared with hydrogel matrices without voids. This study attempted to identify the release mechanism of vitamin B(12) from the two types of prepared scaffolds, and the data were fitted with different release kinetic models. The results revealed that the alginate scaffold exhibited a controlled release profile and that the corresponding release mechanism followed a first-order kinetic model. Hydrogel scaffolds fabricated with biocompatible polymers using fluidic methods could be promising for controlled drug delivery systems.",Journal of applied biomaterials & functional materials,2019 Apr-Jun,Journal Article; Review,10.1177/2280800018817462,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31230497/,
