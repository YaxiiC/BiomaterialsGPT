39669126,3D bioprinting of engineered exosomes secreted from M2-polarized macrophages through immunomodulatory biomaterial promotes in vivo wound healing and angiogenesis.,"Biomaterial composition and surface charge play a critical role in macrophage polarization, providing a molecular cue for immunomodulation and tissue regeneration. In this study, we developed bifunctional hydrogel inks for accelerating M2 macrophage polarization and exosome (Exo) cultivation for wound healing applications. For this, we first fabricated polyamine-modified three-dimensional (3D) printable hydrogels consisting of alginate/gelatin/polydopamine nanospheres (AG/NSPs) to boost M2-exosome (M2-Exo) secretion. The cultivated M2-Exo were finally encapsulated into a biocompatible collagen/decellularized extracellular matrix (COL@d-ECM) bioink for studying angiogenesis and in vivo wound healing study. Our findings show that 3D-printed AGP hydrogel promoted M2 macrophage polarization by Janus kinase/signal transducer of activation (JAK/STAT), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathways and facilitated the M2-Exo secretion. Moreover, the COL@d-ECM/M2-Exo was found to be biocompatible with skin cells. Transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) and real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) study revealed that co-culture of fibroblast/keratinocyte/stem cells/endothelial cells in a 3D bioprinted COL@d-ECM/M2-Exo hydrogel upregulated the skin-associated signature biomarkers through various regulatory pathways during epidermis remodeling and downregulated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway after 7 days. In a subcutaneous wound model, the 3D bioprinted COL@d-ECM/M2-Exo hydrogel displayed robust wound remodeling and hair follicle (HF) induction while reducing canonical pro-inflammatory activation after 14 days, presenting a viable therapeutic strategy for skin-related disorders.",Bioactive materials,2025 Mar,Journal Article,10.1016/j.bioactmat.2024.11.026,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39669126/,
36263100,Enhancing cartilage repair with optimized supramolecular hydrogel-based scaffold and pulsed electromagnetic field.,"Functional tissue engineering strategies provide innovative approach for the repair and regeneration of damaged cartilage. Hydrogel is widely used because it could provide rapid defect filling and proper structure support, and is biocompatible for cell aggregation and matrix deposition. Efforts have been made to seek suitable scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering. Here Alg-DA/Ac-beta-CD/gelatin hydrogel was designed with the features of physical and chemical multiple crosslinking and self-healing properties. Gelation time, swelling ratio, biodegradability and biocompatibility of the hydrogels were systematically characterized, and the injectable self-healing adhesive hydrogel were demonstrated to exhibit ideal properties for cartilage repair. Furthermore, the new hydrogel design introduces a pre-gel state before photo-crosslinking, where increased viscosity and decreased fluidity allow the gel to remain in a semi-solid condition. This granted multiple administration routes to the hydrogels, which brings hydrogels the ability to adapt to complex clinical situations. Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) have been recognized as a promising solution to various health problems owing to their noninvasive properties and therapeutic potentials. PEMF treatment offers a better clinical outcome with fewer, if any, side effects, and wildly used in musculoskeletal tissue repair. Thereby we propose PEMF as an effective biophysical stimulation to be 4th key element in cartilage tissue engineering. In this study, the as-prepared Alg-DA/Ac-beta-CD/gelatin hydrogels were utilized in the rat osteochondral defect model, and the potential application of PEMF in cartilage tissue engineering were investigated. PEMF treatment were proven to enhance the quality of engineered chondrogenic constructs in vitro, and facilitate chondrogenesis and cartilage repair in vivo. All of the results suggested that with the injectable self-healing adhesive hydrogel and PEMF treatment, this newly proposed tissue engineering strategy revealed superior clinical potential for cartilage defect treatment.",Bioactive materials,2023 Apr,Journal Article,10.1016/j.bioactmat.2022.10.010,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36263100/,
36017068,"Wet adhesive hydrogel cardiac patch loaded with anti-oxidative, autophagy-regulating molecule capsules and MSCs for restoring infarcted myocardium.","Hydrogel patch-based stem cell transplantation and microenvironment-regulating drug delivery strategy is promising for the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI). However, the low retention of cells and drugs limits their therapeutic efficacies. Here, we propose a prefixed sponge carpet strategy, that is, aldehyde-dextran sponge (ODS) loading anti-oxidative/autophagy-regulating molecular capsules of 2-hydroxy-beta-cyclodextrin@resveratrol (HP-beta-CD@Res) is first bonded to the rat's heart via capillary removal of interfacial water from the tissue surface, and the subsequent Schiff base reaction between the aldehyde groups on ODS and amino groups on myocardium tissue. Then, an aqueous biocompatible hydrazided hyaluronic acid (HHA) solution encapsulating mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is impregnated into the anchored carpet to form HHA@ODS@HP-beta-CD@Res hydrogel in situ via click reaction, thus prolonging the in vivo retention time of therapeutic drug and cells. Importantly, the HHA added to outer surface consumes the remaining aldehydes to contribute to nonsticky top surface, avoiding adhesion to other tissues. The embedded HP-beta-CD@Res molecular capsules with antioxidant and autophagy regulation bioactivities can considerably improve cardiac microenvironment, reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and enhance the survival of transplanted MSCs, thereby promoting cardiac repair by facilitating angiogenesis and reducing cardiac fibrosis.",Bioactive materials,2023 Mar,Journal Article,10.1016/j.bioactmat.2022.07.029,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36017068/,
34938918,Facile fabrication of a biocompatible composite gel with sustained release of aspirin for bone regeneration.,"Hydrogels are extracellular-matrix-like biomimetic materials that have wide biomedical applications in tissue engineering and drug delivery. However, most hydrogels cannot simultaneously fulfill the mechanical and cell compatibility requirements. In the present study, we prepared a semi-interpenetrating network composite gel (CG) by incorporating short chain chitosan (CS) into a covalent tetra-armed poly(ethylene glycol) network. In addition to satisfying physicochemical, mechanics, biocompatibility, and cell affinity requirements, this CG easily encapsulated acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) via electrostatic interactions and chain entanglement, achieving sustained release for over 14 days and thus promoting periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSC) proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo studies corroborated the capacity of PDLSCs and ASA-laden CG to enhance new bone regeneration in situ using a mouse calvarial bone defect model. This might be attributed to PDLSCs and host mesenchymal stem cells expressing monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, which upregulated M2 macrophage recruitment and polarization in situ, indicating its appealing potential in bone tissue engineering.",Bioactive materials,2022 May,Journal Article,10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.09.033,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34938918/,
34258478,Dual stimuli-responsive polyurethane-based hydrogels as smart drug delivery carriers for the advanced treatment of chronic skin wounds.,"The design of multi-stimuli-responsive vehicles for the controlled and localized release of drugs is a challenging issue increasingly catching the attention of many research groups working on the advanced treatment of hard-to-close wounds. In this work, a thermo- and pH-responsive hydrogel (P-CHP407) was prepared from an ad hoc synthesized amphiphilic poly(ether urethane) (CHP407) exposing a significant amount of -COOH groups (8.8 +/- 0.9 nmol/g(polymer)). The exposure of acid moieties in P-CHP407 hydrogel led to slightly lower initial gelation temperature (12.1  degrees C vs. 14.6  degrees C, respectively) and gelation rate than CHP407 hydrogel, as rheologically assessed. Nanoscale hydrogel characterization by Low Field NMR (LF-NMR) spectroscopy suggested that the presence of carboxylic groups in P-CHP407 caused the formation of bigger micelles with a thicker hydrated shell than CHP407 hydrogels, as further proved by Dynamic Light Scattering analyses. In addition, P-CHP407 hydrogel showed improved capability to change its internal pH compared to CHP407 one when incubated with an alkaline buffer (pH 8) (e.g., pH(change_5min) = 3.76 and 1.32, respectively). Moreover, LF-NMR characterization suggested a stronger alkaline-pH-induced interaction of water molecules with micelles exposing -COOH groups. Lastly, the hydrogels were found biocompatible according to ISO 10993 and able to load and release Ibuprofen: delivery kinetics of Ibuprofen was enhanced by P-CHP407 hydrogels at alkaline pH, suggesting their potential use as smart delivery systems in the treatment of chronic infected wounds.",Bioactive materials,2021 Sep,Journal Article,10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.01.003,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34258478/,
33937592,Self-curling electroconductive nerve dressing for enhancing peripheral nerve regeneration in diabetic rats.,"Conductive sca ff olds have been shown to exert a therapeutic effect on patients suffering from peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs). However, conventional conductive conduits are made of rigid structures and have limited applications for impaired diabetic patients due to their mechanical mismatch with neural tissues and poor plasticity. We propose the development of biocompatible electroconductive hydrogels (ECHs) that are identical to a surgical dressing in this study. Based on excellent adhesive and self-healing properties, the thin film-like dressing can be easily attached to the injured nerve fibers, automatically warps a tubular structure without requiring any invasive techniques. The ECH offers an intimate and stable electrical bridge coupling with the electrogenic nerve tissues. The in vitro experiments indicated that the ECH promoted the migration and adhesion of the Schwann cells. Furthermore, the ECH facilitated axonal regeneration and remyelination in vitro and in vivo through the MEK/ERK pathway, thus preventing muscle denervation atrophy while retaining functional recovery. The results of this study are likely to facilitate the development of non-invasive treatment techniques for PNIs in diabetic patients utilizing electroconductive hydrogels.",Bioactive materials,2021 Nov,Journal Article,10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.03.034,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33937592/,
33869900,Biomimetic injectable hydrogel microspheres with enhanced lubrication and controllable drug release for the treatment of osteoarthritis.,"The occurrence of osteoarthritis (OA) is highly associated with the reduced lubrication property of the joint, where a progressive and irreversible damage of the articular cartilage and consecutive inflammatory response dominate the mechanism. In this study, bioinspired by the super-lubrication property of cartilage and catecholamine chemistry of mussel, we successfully developed injectable hydrogel microspheres with enhanced lubrication and controllable drug release for OA treatment. Particularly, the lubricating microspheres (GelMA@DMA-MPC) were fabricated by dip coating a self-adhesive polymer (DMA-MPC, synthesized by free radical copolymerization) on superficial surface of photo-crosslinked methacrylate gelatin hydrogel microspheres (GelMA, prepared via microfluidic technology), and encapsulated with an anti-inflammatory drug of diclofenac sodium (DS) to achieve the dual-functional performance. The tribological test and drug release test showed the enhanced lubrication and sustained drug release of the GelMA@DMA-MPC microspheres. In addition, the functionalized microspheres were intra-articularly injected into the rat knee joint with an OA model, and the biological tests including qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining assay, X-ray radiography and histological staining assay all revealed that the biocompatible microspheres provided significant therapeutic effect against the development of OA. In summary, the injectable hydrogel microspheres developed herein greatly improved lubrication and achieved sustained local drug release, therefore representing a facile and promising technique for the treatment of OA.",Bioactive materials,2021 Oct,Journal Article,10.1016/j.bioactmat.2021.03.022,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33869900/,
