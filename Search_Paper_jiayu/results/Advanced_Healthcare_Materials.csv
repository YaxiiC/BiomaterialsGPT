39713898,Structured Polymers Enable the Sustained Delivery of Glucocorticoids within the Intra-Articular Space.,"Intra-articular glucocorticoid injections are effective in controlling inflammation and pain in arthritides but restricted by short duration of action and risk of joint degeneration. Controlled drug release using biocompatible hydrogels offers a unique solution, but limitations of in situ gelation restrict their application. Gellan sheared hydrogels (GSHs) retain the advantages of hydrogels, however their unique microstructures lend themselves to intra-articular application - capable of shear thinning under force but restructuring at rest to enhance residence. This study examined GSHs for extended intra-articular glucocorticoid delivery of prednisolone (10 mg mL(-1)); demonstrating links between material mechanics, steroid release, and preclinical assessment of efficacy in synoviocyte culture and transgenic(TNF)197Gkl (TNFtg) murine model of arthritis. GSHs demonstrated sustained release, with typical Fickian profiles over 18 days. Moreover, systems showed good stability under extended culture, with inherent cell-compatibility and suppression of inflammatory synoviocyte activation. In TNFtg animals, GSHs suppressed synovitis (70.08%, p < 0.05), pannus formation (45.01%, p < 0.05), and increased articular cartilage (82.23%, p < 0.05) relative to vehicle controls. The extended profile of steroid release from injectable GSH formulations holds promise in the treatment and management of inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, representing a step-change in intra-articular drug delivery to suppress long-term joint inflammation.",Advanced healthcare materials,2025 Feb,Journal Article,10.1002/adhm.202403000,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39713898/,
39558805,In Situ Sprayed Hydrogel Delivers Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Human Endometrial Organoids for Uterine Function Preservation and Fertility Restoration.,"Impaired endometrial function and reduced receptivity remain significant causes of female infertility. Here, a sprayable hydrogel combined with human endometrial organoid extracellular vesicles (HEO-EVs) is developed to enhance uterine function preservation and fertility restoration. The peptide amphiphile hydrogel (labeled CPA) is engineered by conjugating a collagen-binding peptide with glutathione to impart its biocompatible adhesive and antioxidant properties. The therapeutic EVs are isolated and purified from human endometrial organoids that have been stably passaged long-term using a bioreactor-culture system. The resulting HEO-EVs-loaded CPA (CPA@HEO-EVs) rapid gelation, triggered by salt-ion interactions, occurs when the fluid is sprayed onto the uterine lining. The ex vivo studies demonstrate that CPA@HEO-EVs promote cell proliferation, scavenges free radicals, and increases tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In vivo experiments further validate that in situ spraying with the CPA@HEO-EVs can promote neovascularization, prevent localized endometrial fibrosis, and effectively enhance fertility in a mouse model of endometrial injury. These findings highlight the promising clinical application of in situ sprayed CPA@HEO-EVs hydrogel for targeted endometrial therapy.",Advanced healthcare materials,2025 Jan,Journal Article,10.1002/adhm.202403604,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39558805/,
39520382,Minimally Invasive Syringe-Injectable Hydrogel with Angiogenic Factors for Ischemic Stroke Treatment.,"Ischemic stroke (IS) accounts for most stroke incidents and causes intractable damage to brain tissue. This condition manifests as diverse aftereffects, such as motor impairment, emotional disturbances, and dementia. However, a fundamental approach to curing IS remains unclear. This study proposes a novel approach for treating IS by employing minimally invasive and injectable jammed gelatin-norbornene nanofibrous hydrogels (GNF) infused with growth factors (GFs). The developed GNF/GF hydrogels are administered to the motor cortex of a rat IS model to evaluate their therapeutic effects on IS-induced motor dysfunction. GNFs mimic a natural fibrous extracellular matrix architecture and can be precisely injected into a targeted brain area. The syringe-injectable jammed nanofibrous hydrogel system increased angiogenesis, inflammation, and sensorimotor function in the IS-affected brain. For clinical applications, the biocompatible GNF hydrogel has the potential to efficiently load disease-specific drugs, enabling targeted therapy for treating a wide range of neurological diseases.",Advanced healthcare materials,2025 Mar,Journal Article,10.1002/adhm.202403119,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39520382/,
39148284,Self-Assembled Peptide Hydrogels Loaded with Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Repairing Injured Endometrium and Restoring Fertility.,"Endometrial injury is a major cause of infertility and recurrent miscarriage. However, no clinically available methods currently exist to effectively repair the damaged endometrium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for promoting tissue regeneration, yet a biocompatible scaffold capable of delivering MSCs and supporting their growth is needed. Herein, the study reports a peptide hydrogel scaffold, self-assembled from a peptide IVK8-RGD consisting of an ionic complementary peptide sequence IEVEIRVK and a bioactive sequence RGD, to load umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs). This peptide forms a hydrogel under the physiological condition through self-assembly, and the peptide hydrogel exhibits injectability and adhesiveness to uterus, making it suitable for endometrial repair. Importantly, this hydrogel supports the adhesion and proliferation of UC-MSCs in a 3D environment. In vivo experiments using rats with endometrial injury have shown that treatment with IVK8-RGD hydrogel loaded with UC-MSCs effectively restores endometrial thickness, inhibits fibrosis, and facilitates angiogenesis through activating Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, leading to significantly improved fertility and live birth rate. These findings demonstrate the potential of the UC-MSCs-loaded hydrogel in repairing damaged endometrium and may address the unmet clinical needs of treating recurrent miscarriage and infertility induced by endometrial damage.",Advanced healthcare materials,2024 Dec,Journal Article,10.1002/adhm.202400524,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39148284/,
39138998,Essential Oil Components Incorporated Emulsion Hydrogels for Eradicating Dermatophytosis Caused by Pathogenic Fungi Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Microsporum canis.,"Dermatophytosis is a prevalent fungal infection and public health burden, majorly caused by the attack of zoophilic fungi genera of Trichophyton and Microsporum. Among them, T. mentagrophytes and M. canis are the dominating pathogens that cause dermatophytosis in humans. Though anti-fungal treatments are available, the widespread drug resistance and minimal efficacy of conventional therapies cause recurring infections. In addition, prolonged anti-fungal medications induce several systemic side effects, including hepatotoxicity and leucopenia. The anti-dermatophytic formulation of biocompatible essential oil components (EOCs) is attractive due to their highly potent anti-dermatophytic action. Herein, two EOCs, Eugenol (EU) and Isoeugenol (IU), incorporated emulsion hydrogel (EOCs-EHG) synthesized from hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate. The cytocompatibility of the hydrogels is confirmed by treating them with fibroblast and keratinocyte cell lines. The EOCs-EHG demonstrated pH and temperature-responsive sustained release of entrapped EOCs and inhibited fungal spore germination. T. mentagrophytes and M. canis biofilms are eradicated at a minimal inhibitory concentration of 2 microg mL(-1) each of EU and IU. The in vivo anti-dermatophytic activity of EOCs-EHG is confirmed in dermatophyte-infected Wistar albino rat models. The topical application of EOCs-EHG demonstrated complete infection eradication and facilitated skin regeneration, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of EOCs-EHG against dermatophytosis.",Advanced healthcare materials,2024 Nov,Journal Article,10.1002/adhm.202400811,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39138998/,
38663034,Inflammation-Responsive Hydrogel Accelerates Diabetic Wound Healing through Immunoregulation and Enhanced Angiogenesis.,"Angiogenesis is a prominent component during the highly regulated process of wound healing. The application of exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has shown considerable potential in facilitating angiogenesis. However, its effectiveness is often curtailed due to chronic inflammation and severe oxidative stress in diabetic wounds. Herein, an inflammation-responsive hydrogel incorporating Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) is designed to augment the angiogenic efficacy of VEGF. Specifically, the rapid release of PBNPs from the hydrogel under inflammatory conditions effectively alleviates the oxidative stress of the wound, therefore reprogramming the immune microenvironment to preserve the bioactivity of VEGF for enhanced angiogenesis. In vitro and in vivo studies reveal that the PBNPs and VEGF co-loaded hydrogel is biocompatible and possesses effective anti-inflammatory properties, thereby facilitating angiogenesis to accelerate the wound healing process in a type 2 diabetic mouse model.",Advanced healthcare materials,2025 Feb,Journal Article,10.1002/adhm.202400150,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38663034/,
38488218,Versatile Mechanically Tunable Hydrogels for Therapeutic Delivery Applications.,"Hydrogels provide a versatile platform for biomedical material fabrication that can be structurally and mechanically fine-tuned to various tissues and applications. Applications of hydrogels in biomedicine range from highly dynamic injectable hydrogels that can flow through syringe needles and maintain or recover their structure after extrusion to solid-like wound-healing patches that need to be stretchable while providing a selective physical barrier. In this study, a toolbox is designed using thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) polymeric matrices and nanocelluloses as reinforcing agent to obtain biocompatible hydrogels with altering mechanical properties, from a liquid injectable to a solid-like elastic hydrogel. The liquid hydrogels possess low viscosity and shear-thinning properties at 25  degrees C, which allows facile injection at room temperature, while they become viscoelastic gels at body temperature. In contrast, the covalently cross-linked solid-like hydrogels exhibit enhanced viscoelasticity. The liquid hydrogels are biocompatible and are able to delay the in vitro release and maintain the bioactivity of model drugs. The antimicrobial agent loaded solid-like hydrogels are effective against typical wound-associated pathogens. This work presents a simple method of tuning hydrogel mechanical strength to easily adapt to applications in different soft tissues and broaden the potential of renewable bio-nanoparticles in hybrid biomaterials with controlled drug release capabilities.",Advanced healthcare materials,2024 Jul,Journal Article,10.1002/adhm.202304287,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38488218/,
37903562,An Electroconductive and Antibacterial Adhesive Nanocomposite Hydrogel for High-Performance Skin Wound Healing.,"Multifunctional hydrogel adhesives inhibiting infections and enabling the electrical stimulation (ES) of tissue reparation are highly desirable for the healing of surgical wounds and other skin injuries. Herein, a therapeutic nanocomposite hydrogel is designed by integrating beta-cyclodextrin-embedded Ag nanoparticles ((CD)AgNPs) in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix enhanced with free beta-cyclodextrin (CD) and an atypical macromolecule made of beta-glucan grafted with hyaluronic acid (HAG). The main objective is to develop a biocompatible dressing combining the electroconductivity and antibacterial activity of (CD)AgNPs with the cohesiveness and porosity of PVA and the anti-inflammatory, moisturizing, and cell proliferation-promoting properties of HAG. The last component, CD, is added to strengthen the network structure of the hydrogel. PVA/CD/HAG/(CD)AgNP exhibited excellent adhesion strength, biocompatibility, electroconductivity, and antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria. In addition, the nanocomposite hydrogel has a swelling ratio and water retention capacity suitable to serve as a wound dressing. PVA/CD/HAG/(CD)AgNP promoted the proliferation of fibroblast in vitro, accelerated the healing of skin wounds in an animal model, and is hemostatic. Upon ES, the PVA/CD/HAG/(CD)AgNP nanocomposite hydrogel became more efficient both in vitro and in vivo further speeding up the skin healing process thus demonstrating its potential as a next-generation electroconductive wound dressing.",Advanced healthcare materials,2024 Mar,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/adhm.202303138,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37903562/,
37861278,An Ultraswelling Microneedle Device for Facile and Efficient Drug Loading and Transdermal Delivery.,"The advancement and extensive demand for transdermal therapies can benefit from a safe, and efficient and user-friendly transdermal technology with broad applicability in delivering various hydrophilic drugs. Here the design and proof of concept applications of an ultraswelling microneedle device that enables the facile and efficient loading and transdermal delivery of hydrophilic drugs with different molecular weights is reported. The device consists of a super-hydrophilic hydrogel microneedle array and a resin base substrate. Using a special micromolding technique that involves hydrated crosslinking and cryogenic-demolding, the microneedle part displays a rapid swelling ratio of  approximately 3800%, enabling the loading of drugs up to 500 kDa in molecular weight. The drug loading process using the device just involves incubating the microneedle part in a drug solution for 1 min, followed by 15 min of drying. The microneedles can easily penetrate the skin under press and detach from the base substrate under shear, thereby releasing the payload. Administration of desired therapeutic agents using the device outperformed conventional administration methods in mitigating psoriasis and eliciting immunity. This biocompatible device, capable of withstanding ethylene oxide sterilization, can enhance the efficacy and accessibility of transdermal therapies in research institutes, hospitals, and even home settings.",Advanced healthcare materials,2024 Jan,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/adhm.202302406,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37861278/,
37610041,"A Biodegradable, Adhesive, and Stretchable Hydrogel and Potential Applications for Allergic Rhinitis and Epistaxis.","Bioadhesive hydrogels have attracted considerable attention as innovative materials in medical interventions and human-machine interface engineering. Despite significant advances in their application, it remains critical to develop adhesive hydrogels that meet the requirements for biocompatibility, biodegradability, long-term strong adhesion, and efficient drug delivery vehicles in moist conditions. A biocompatible, biodegradable, soft, and stretchable hydrogel made from a combination of a biopolymer (unmodified natural gelatin) and stretchable biodegradable poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate is proposed to achieve durable and tough adhesion and explore its use for convenient and effective intranasal hemostasis and drug administration. Desirable hemostasis efficacy and enhanced therapeutic outcomes for allergic rhinitis are accomplished. Biodegradation enables the spontaneous removal of materials without causing secondary damage and minimizes medical waste. Preliminary trials on human subjects provide an essential foundation for practical applications.

37507108,Orthogonal Gelations to Synthesize Core-Shell Hydrogels Loaded with Nanoemulsion-Templated Drug Nanoparticles for Versatile Oral Drug Delivery.,"Hydrophobic active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are ubiquitous in the drug development pipeline, but their poor bioavailability often prevents their translation into drug products. Industrial processes to formulate hydrophobic APIs are expensive, difficult to optimize, and not flexible enough to incorporate customizable drug release profiles into drug products. Here, a novel, dual-responsive gelation process that exploits orthogonal thermo-responsive and ion-responsive gelations is introduced. This one-step ""dual gelation"" synthesizes core-shell (methylcellulose-alginate) hydrogel particles and encapsulates drug-laden nanoemulsions in the hydrogel matrices. In situ crystallization templates drug nanocrystals inside the polymeric core, while a kinetically stable amorphous solid dispersion is templated in the shell. Drug release is explored as a function of particle geometry, and programmable release is demonstrated for various therapeutic applications including delayed pulsatile release and sequential release of a model fixed-dose combination drug product of ibuprofen and fenofibrate. Independent control over drug loading between the shell and the core is demonstrated. This formulation approach is shown to be a flexible process to develop drug products with biocompatible materials, facile synthesis, and precise drug release performance. This work suggests and applies a novel method to leverage orthogonal gel chemistries to generate functional core-shell hydrogel particles.",Advanced healthcare materials,2023 Dec,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",10.1002/adhm.202301667,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37507108/,
36177679,Squid Suckerin-Spider Silk Fusion Protein Hydrogel for Delivery of Mesenchymal Stem Cell Secretome to Chronic Wounds.,"Chronic wounds are non-healing wounds characterized by a prolonged inflammation phase. Excessive inflammation leads to elevated protease levels and consequently to a decrease in growth factors at wound sites. Stem cell secretome therapy has been identified as a treatment strategy to modulate the microenvironment of chronic wounds via supplementation with anti-inflammatory/growth factors. However, there is a need to develop better secretome delivery systems that are able to encapsulate the secretome without denaturation, in a sustained manner, and that are fully biocompatible. To address this gap, a recombinant squid suckerin-spider silk fusion protein is developed with cell-adhesion motifs capable of thermal gelation at physiological temperatures to form hydrogels for encapsulation and subsequent release of the stem cell secretome. Freeze-thaw treatment of the protein hydrogel results in a modified porous cryogel that maintains slow degradation and sustained secretome release. Chronic wounds of diabetic mice treated with the secretome-laden cryogel display increased wound closure, presence of endothelial cells, granulation wound tissue thickness, and reduced inflammation with no fibrotic scar formation. Overall, these in vivo indicators of wound healing demonstrate that the fusion protein hydrogel displays remarkable potential as a delivery system for secretome-assisted chronic wound healing.",Advanced healthcare materials,2023 Jan,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/adhm.202201900,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36177679/,
36028466,Biohybrid Response Microparticles Decorated with Trained-MSCs for Acute Liver Failure Recovery.,"Microcarrier-based mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) delivery have attracted increasing attention in acute liver failure (ALF) therapy, while there is still room for improvement in terms of improving cell loading efficiency, enhancing anti-inflammatory features, and controlling cell release. Here, novel lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-composited magnetic-thermal responsive inverse opal particles (MIOPs) are presented for the delivery of MSCs. The MIOPs are composed of a chitosan inverse opal skeleton filled with a hydrogel containing LPS, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), and Fe(3) O(4) nanoparticles. Benefitting from the biocompatible chitosan component and the huge specific surface area, the resultant MIOPs can capture MSCs in a nondestructive way. Furthermore, LPS can be released from the MIOPs under the stimulation of an alternating magnetic field, by which the MSCs are activated to gain the feature of ""trained immunity."" Moreover, this process can be monitored in real-time by the structural color change of the MIOPs. With that, the MSCs-laden MIOPs are employed in rats with ALF, and they exhibit obvious anti-inflammatory and therapeutic efficacy superior to untrained MSCs. These performances make the MIOPs a distinctive cell delivery platform for clinical tissue recovery applications.",Advanced healthcare materials,2022 Nov,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/adhm.202201085,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36028466/,
33690992,Responsive Hydrogel Microcarrier-Integrated Microneedles for Versatile and Controllable Drug Delivery.,"Stratagems of drug delivery are important for disease treatment and other biomedical areas. In this study, a novel stratagem is presented for versatile and controllable drug delivery by integrating photoresponsive drug delivery microspheres (PDDMs) into pyramid microneedle (MN) arrays. The PDDMs, containing black-phosphorus (BP) and poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM), are generated by a flexible capillary microfluidic method. Benefiting from the high water content of the pNIPAM hydrogel, various bioactive substances can be loaded and maintain biological activity. Furthermore, due to the near-infrared (NIR) absorption and conversion capabilities of the contained BP, the PDDMs can increase temperature, shrink volume, and release their encapsulated bioactives under the trigger of biocompatible NIR. In addition, as the PDDMs are stuffed into the solid MN arrays of porous ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA), the composited PDDMs-MNs system has enough mechanical strength to penetrate into the skin and can deliver drugs underneath the skin uniformly. Based on the resultant PDDMs-MNs, it is demonstrated that insulin can be controllably released to adjust blood glucose levels of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Thus, it is believed that the PDDMs-MNs can act as an excellent drugs delivery system and will find many practical values in clinical medicine.",Advanced healthcare materials,2021 May,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/adhm.202002249,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33690992/,
30985089,Magnetic Hydrogel with Optimally Adaptive Functions for Breast Cancer Recurrence Prevention.,"Engineering biocompatible hydrogels using functional nanoparticles has attracted considerable attention because of their uniquely appealing cooperative effects that can enable multimodality imaging and treatment with improved efficacy against serious diseases. However, the effects of high-content nanoparticle dopants on the rheological properties of hydrogels frequently lead to an unsatisfactory therapeutic result, which is particularly notable in the design of magnetic hydrogel formulations for cancer therapy. Herein is reported a novel magnetic hydrogel functionalized by ferromagnetic vortex-domain iron oxide (FVIOs) with optimally adaptive functions for prevention of breast cancer recurrence. The FVIOs can perfectly incorporate into the dynamic hydrogel networks with an extremely low concentration (0.6 mg mL(-1) ), 17 times lower than that of conventional superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with sufficient heating capacity. Such magnetic hydrogels exhibit high inductive heating and remarkable rheological properties simultaneously. Moreover, the self-healing, self-conformal ability, controlled release of loaded doxorubicin, biodegradation, and pH-responsiveness of the magnetic hydrogel project their efficient sustainable therapeutic ability. In vivo postoperative treatment has further demonstrated the high efficacy of FVIO-based magnetic hydrogels, as evidenced by the significant suppression of the local tumor recurrences compared to chemotherapy or hyperthermia alone. This unique magnetic hydrogel formulation with optimally adaptive functions shows strong potential in preventing relapses of various cancers.",Advanced healthcare materials,2019 Jul,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/adhm.201900203,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30985089/,
30985084,A Versatile Biocompatible Antibiotic Delivery System Based on Self-Assembling Peptides with Antimicrobial and Regenerative Potential.,"Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory and tissue-destructive disease. Since the polymicrobiome in the oral cavity makes it difficult to treat, novel therapeutic strategies are required. Hydrogels based on self-assembling peptides (SAP) can be suitable candidates for periodontal therapy due to their injectability, biocompatibility, cargo-loading capacity, and tunable physicochemical and mechanical properties. In this study, two SAP hydrogels (P11-4 and P11-28/29) are examined for their intrinsic antimicrobial activity, regenerative potential, and antibiotic delivery capacity. A significant antibacterial effect of P11-28/29 hydrogels on the periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis and a less pronounced effect for P11-4 hydrogels is demonstrated. The metabolic activity rates of human dental follicle stem cells (DFSCs), which reflect cell viability and may thus indicate the regenerative capacity, are similar on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) and on P11-4 hydrogels after 14 days of culture. Noticeably, both SAP hydrogels strengthen the osteogenic differentiation of DFSCs compared with TCPS. The incorporation of tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and doxycycline does not affect fibril formation of either SAP hydrogel and results in favorable release kinetics up to 120 h. In summary, this study reveals that P11-SAP hydrogels combine many favorable properties required to make them applicable as prospective novel treatment strategy for periodontal therapy.",Advanced healthcare materials,2019 Jul,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/adhm.201900167,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30985084/,
30714355,A Biocompatible Therapeutic Catheter-Deliverable Hydrogel for In Situ Tissue Engineering.,"Hydrogels have emerged as a diverse class of biomaterials offering a broad range of biomedical applications. Specifically, injectable hydrogels are advantageous for minimally invasive delivery of various therapeutics and have great potential to treat a number of diseases. However, most current injectable hydrogels are limited by difficult and time-consuming fabrication techniques and are unable to be delivered through long, narrow catheters, preventing extensive clinical translation. Here, the development of an easily-scaled, catheter-injectable hydrogel utilizing a polymer-nanoparticle crosslinking mechanism is reported, which exhibits notable shear-thinning and self-healing behavior. Gelation of the hydrogel occurs immediately upon mixing the biochemically modified hyaluronic acid polymer with biodegradable nanoparticles and can be easily injected through a high-gauge syringe due to the dynamic nature of the strong, yet reversible crosslinks. Furthermore, the ability to deliver this novel hydrogel through a long, narrow, physiologically-relevant catheter affixed with a 28-G needle is highlighted, with hydrogel mechanics unchanged after delivery. Due to the composition of the gel, it is demonstrated that therapeutics can be differentially released with distinct elution profiles, allowing precise control over drug delivery. Finally, the cell-signaling and biocompatibility properties of this innovative hydrogel are demonstrated, revealing its wide range of therapeutic applications.",Advanced healthcare materials,2019 Mar,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/adhm.201801147,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30714355/,
30485718,Enhanced Osteogenesis of Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells by a Functionalized Silk Fibroin Hydrogel for Bone Defect Repair.,"Silk fibroin (SF) from Bombyx mori is a promising natural material for the synthesis of biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogels for use in biomedical applications from tissue engineering to drug delivery. However, weak gelation performance and the lack of biochemical cues to trigger cell proliferation and differentiation currently significantly limit its application in these areas. Herein, a biofunctional hydrogel containing SF (2.0%) and a small peptide gelator (e.g., NapFFRGD = 1.0 wt%) is generated via cooperative molecular self-assembly. The introduction of NapFFRGD to SF is shown to significantly improve its gelation properties by lowering both its threshold gelation concentration to 2.0% and gelation time to 20 min under physiological conditions (pH = 7.4, 37  degrees C), as well as functionalizing the SF hydrogel with cell-adhesive motifs (e.g., RGD). Besides mediating cell adhesion, the RGD ligands incorporated within the SF-RGD gel promote the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells encapsulated within the gel matrix, leading to bone regeneration in a mouse calvarial defect model, compared with a blank SF gel (2.0%, pH = 7.4). This work suggests that SF could be easily tailored with bioactive peptide gelators to afford bioactive hydrogels with favorable microenvironments for tissue regeneration applications.",Advanced healthcare materials,2019 Feb,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/adhm.201801043,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30485718/,
29508554,Conceptually Novel Black Phosphorus/Cellulose Hydrogels as Promising Photothermal Agents for Effective Cancer Therapy.,"Black phosphorus (BP) has recently emerged as an intriguing photothermal agent in photothermal therapy (PTT) against cancer by virtue of its high photothermal efficiency, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. However, naked BP is intrinsically characterized by easy oxidation (or natural degradation) and sedimentation inside the tumor microenvironment, leading to a short-term therapeutic and inhomogeneous photothermal effect. Development of BP-based nanocomposites for PTT against cancer therefore remains challenging. The present work demonstrates that green and injectable composite hydrogels based on cellulose and BP nanosheets (BPNSs) are of great efficiency for PTT against cancer. The resultant cellulose/BPNS-based hydrogel possesses 3D networks with irregular micrometer-sized pores and thin, strong cellulose-formed walls and exhibits an excellent photothermal response, enhanced stability, and good flexibility. Importantly, this hydrogel nanoplatform is totally harmless and biocompatible both in vivo and in vitro.

In this study a mussel-inspired, nanocomposite-based, biodegradable tissue adhesive is developed by blending poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) or N-hydroxysuccinimide modified PLGA nanoparticles (PLGA-NHS) with mussel-inspired alginate-dopamine polymer (Alg-Dopa). Adhesive strength measurement of the nanocomposites on porcine skin-muscle constructs reveals that the incorporation of nanoparticles in Alg-Dopa significantly enhances the tissue adhesive strength compared to the mussel-inspired adhesive alone. The nanocomposite formed by PLGA-NHS nanoparticles shows higher lap shear strength of 33 +/- 3 kPa, compared to that of Alg-Dopa hydrogel alone (14 +/- 2 kPa). In addition, these nanocomposites are degradable and cytocompatible in vitro, and elicit in vivo minimal inflammatory responses in a rat model, suggesting clinical potential of these nanocomposites as bioadhesives.",Advanced healthcare materials,2018 Apr,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",10.1002/adhm.201701069,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29205950/,

Here, biocompatible hydrogels represent an excellent option for the delivery of pharmacologically active molecules to the bone tissue because of their biodegradability, injectability, and manifold functionalization capacity. The present study reports the preparation of a multifunctional hybrid hydrogel from chemically modified human serum albumin and rationally designed DNA building blocks. The hybrid hydrogel combines advantageous characteristics, including rapid gelation through DNA hybridization under physiological conditions and a self-healing and injectable nature with the possibility of specific loading and spatiotemporally controlled release of active proteins, making it an advanced biomaterial for the local treatment of bone diseases, for example, osteoporosis. The hydrogels are loaded with a recombinant Rho-inhibiting C3 toxin, C2IN-C3lim-G205C. This toxin selectively targets osteoclasts and inhibits Rho-signaling and, thereby, actin-dependent processes in these cells. Application of C2IN-C3lim-G205C toxin-loaded hydrogels effectively reduces osteoclast formation and resorption activity in vitro, as demonstrated by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and the pit resorption assay. Simultaneously, osteoblast activity, viability, and proliferation are unaffected, thus making C2IN-C3lim-G205C toxin-loaded hybrid hydrogels an attractive pharmacological system for spatial and selective modulation of osteoclast functions to reduce bone resorption.",Advanced healthcare materials,2017 Nov,Journal Article,10.1002/adhm.201700392,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28758712/,
