34905737,Dynamic hyaluronic acid hydrogel with covalent linked gelatin as an anti-oxidative bioink for cartilage tissue engineering.,"In the past decade, cartilage tissue engineering has arisen as a promising therapeutic option for degenerative joint diseases, such as osteoarthritis, in the hope of restoring the structure and physiological functions. Hydrogels are promising biomaterials for developing engineered scaffolds for cartilage regeneration. However, hydrogel-delivered mesenchymal stem cells or chondrocytes could be exposed to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the inflammatory microenvironment after being implanted into injured joints, which may affect their phenotype and normal functions and thereby hinder the regeneration efficacy. To attenuate ROS induced side effects, a multifunctional hydrogel with an innate anti-oxidative ability was produced in this study. The hydrogel was rapidly formed through a dynamic covalent bond between phenylboronic acid grafted hyaluronic acid (HA-PBA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) and was further stabilized through a secondary crosslinking between the acrylate moiety on HA-PBA and the free thiol group from thiolated gelatin. The hydrogel is cyto-compatible and injectable and can be used as a bioink for 3D bioprinting. The viscoelastic properties of the hydrogels could be modulated through the hydrogel precursor concentration. The presence of dynamic covalent linkages contributed to its shear-thinning property and thus good printability of the hydrogel, resulting in the fabrication of a porous grid construct and a meniscus like scaffold at high structural fidelity. The bioprinted hydrogel promoted cell adhesion and chondrogenic differentiation of encapsulated rabbit adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells. Meanwhile, the hydrogel supported robust deposition of extracellular matrix components, including glycosaminoglycans and type II collagen, by embedded mouse chondrocytesin vitro. Most importantly, the hydrogel could protect encapsulated chondrocytes from ROS induced downregulation of cartilage-specific anabolic genes (ACAN and COL2) and upregulation of a catabolic gene (MMP13) after incubation with H(2)O(2). Furthermore, intra-articular injection of the hydrogel in mice revealed adequate stability and good biocompatibilityin vivo. These results demonstrate that this hydrogel can be used as a novel bioink for the generation of 3D bioprinted constructs with anti-ROS ability to potentially enhance cartilage tissue regeneration in a chronic inflammatory and elevated ROS microenvironment.",Biofabrication,2021 Dec 31,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1088/1758-5090/ac42de,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34905737/,
31783391,Three-dimensional cartilage tissue regeneration system harnessing goblet-shaped microwells containing biocompatible hydrogel.,"Differentiation of stem cells into chondrocytes has been studied for the engineering of cartilage tissue. However, stem cells cultured two-dimensionally have limited ability to differentiate into chondrocytes, which led to the development of three-dimensional culture systems. A recently developed microtechnological method uses microwells as a tool to form uniformly sized spheroids. In this study, we fabricated an array (10 x 10) of goblet-shaped microwells based on polydimethylsiloxane for spheroid culture. A central processing unit (CPU) was used to form holes, and metallic beads were used to form hemispherical microwell geometry. The holes were filled with Pluronic F-127 to prevent cells from sinking through the holes and allowing the cells to form spheroids. Viability and chondrogenic differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells were assessed. The fabrication method using a micro-pin mold and metallic beads is easy and cost-effective. Our three-dimensional spheroid culture system optimizes the efficient differentiation of cells and has various applications, such as drug delivery, cell therapy, and tissue engineering.",Biofabrication,2019 Dec 23,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1088/1758-5090/ab5d3e,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31783391/,
