39570116,DNA Aptamers That Bind to Alginate Hydrogels.,"Hydrogels have become common in wound treatment because they form very stable and biocompatible environments that promote healing. However, due to the highly porous hydrogel structure, any therapeutic added to these gels tends to diffuse quickly and impact delivery to the target site. Aptamers are short, single-stranded DNA or RNA sequences that bind specifically to a target, so aptamers that bind to hydrogels could serve as tags for therapeutics to prevent rapid diffusion and allow for extended delivery. An in vitro selection approach was developed to identify DNA aptamers for alginate hydrogels. Two DNA aptamers were shown to bind hydrogels ranging from 0.5 to 2% alginate and could be either encapsulated during gelation or introduced to preformed gels. Both aptamers also showed specificity for binding to alginate compared to agarose. To demonstrate the functional aspect of the aptamers as tethers for other biomolecules, both aptamers were conjugated to BSA. Aptamer-conjugated BSA was retained longer in the hydrogel during week-long diffusion studies both when encapsulated or introduced to preformed gels, which adds flexibility to how these aptamers can be deployed in a clinical setting.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2024 Dec 9,Journal Article,10.1021/acsbiomaterials.4c01436,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39570116/,
38416058,Recent Biomaterial-Assisted Approaches for Immunotherapeutic Inhibition of Cancer Recurrence.,"Biomaterials possess distinctive properties, notably their ability to encapsulate active biological products while providing biocompatible support. The immune system plays a vital role in preventing cancer recurrence, and there is considerable demand for an effective strategy to prevent cancer recurrence, necessitating effective strategies to address this concern. This review elucidates crucial cellular signaling pathways in cancer recurrence. Furthermore, it underscores the potential of biomaterial-based tools in averting or inhibiting cancer recurrence by modulating the immune system. Diverse biomaterials, including hydrogels, particles, films, microneedles, etc., exhibit promising capabilities in mitigating cancer recurrence. These materials are compelling candidates for cancer immunotherapy, offering in situ immunostimulatory activity through transdermal, implantable, and injectable devices. They function by reshaping the tumor microenvironment and impeding tumor growth by reducing immunosuppression. Biomaterials facilitate alterations in biodistribution, release kinetics, and colocalization of immunostimulatory agents, enhancing the safety and efficacy of therapy. Additionally, how the method addresses the limitations of other therapeutic approaches is discussed.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2024 Mar 11,Journal Article; Review,10.1021/acsbiomaterials.3c01347,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38416058/,
38288701,Efficient Loading and Sustained Delivery of Methotrexate Using a Tip-Swellable Microneedle Array Patch for Psoriasis Treatment.,"Methotrexate (MTX), a primary treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis, is limited in clinical use due to suboptimal results and severe side effects from subcutaneous (SC) injection and oral administration. Microneedles offer a promising alternative for direct MTX delivery to targeted skin lesions, but issues such as drug wastage, dosage inaccuracy, and limited drug residence time in the lesions remain. This study introduces a tip-swellable microneedle array patch (TSMAP) using photo-cross-linked methacrylated hyaluronic acid (MeHA) and biocompatible resin for effective MTX loading and sustained delivery. A two-cast micromolding with vacuum drying is employed to concentrate cross-linked MeHA in about 30% of the needle's height at the tip, thereby ensuring that only the TSMAP tip swells. Efficient MTX loading into TSMAP tips is achieved through a 30 s drug solution immersion and 10 min drying, potentially minimizing drug waste from incomplete skin insertion due to skin elasticity. The MTX-loaded TSMAP effectively penetrates both porcine and psoriasis-like mouse skin with its tips detaching from the resin substrate and embedding deeply into the skin tissue, thereby functioning as a drug release reservoir. TSMAP significantly prolongs drug retention in skin compared with SC injection and dissolvable microneedles. The in vivo study demonstrates that TSMAP-mediated MTX delivery substantially enhances therapeutic outcomes in alleviating psoriasis symptoms and downregulating psoriasis-associated cytokines, outperforming oral administration, SC injection, and dissolvable microneedles. Thus, TSMAP could offer an efficient and user-friendly alternative for drug administration in the treatment of various skin diseases.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2024 Feb 12,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1021/acsbiomaterials.3c01810,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38288701/,
37593880,Highly Biocompatible Smart Injectable Hydrogel for the Management of Rheumatoid Arthritis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that severely affects joints and restricts locomotion. Various treatment regimens are available for RA, providing short-term relief from pain, but long-term relief from the disease is still not available. Evidently, cytokines play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of the disease. However, aberrant immune responses, genetic dispositions, viral infections, or toxicants are some possible causative mediators of RA. The synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients encompass cytokines, especially osteoclastogenic cytokines, and invasion factors such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and the receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL). Moreover, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukins (IL-1, 6, and 17) intensify osteoclast differentiation and activation. Therefore, in order to restrict the cytokine expression, we used budesonide as a therapeutic lead and encapsulated it into a highly biocompatible hydrogel system. The hydrogel system developed by us is enzyme-responsive and provides sustained drug release flow over an extended period of time. This hydrogel is characterized by zeta-potential analysis, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, and it is further encapsulated with budesonide (glucocorticoids) for therapeutic purposes. Evidently, Bud-loaded ER-hydrogel showed improvement in joint physiology compared to the disease group and downregulated the inflammatory markers.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2023 Sep 11,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1021/acsbiomaterials.3c00514,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37593880/,
35384655,"Smart Hydrogel Sensors with Antifreezing, Antifouling Properties for Wound Healing.","Flexible electronic devices with biological therapeutic and sensing properties are one of the current research directions. Here, a multifunctional hydrogel for stress sensing and wound healing was prepared by a simple one-pot method and a solution replacement method. Among them, zwitterionic polymers promote wound healing by promoting the polarization of M2 macrophages, collagen deposition, and blood vessel formation. Glycerin can significantly improve the resilience and frost resistance of the hydrogel, ensuring that a sensor made using the hydrogel can work normally in a cold environment. In addition, zwitterionic polymers are highly biocompatible, providing excellent antibacterial adhesion to aid the wound healing process, and good electrical conductivity enhances sensing sensitivity and stability. Based on these properties, multifunctional hydrogels could detect human vital activities while promoting wound healing, providing new ideas for the fields of diagnosis and wound dressing.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2022 May 9,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c01599,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35384655/,
34081451,Polyplex-Loaded Hydrogels for Local Gene Delivery to Human Dermal Fibroblasts.,"Impaired cutaneous healing leading to chronic wounds affects between 2 and 6% of the total population in most developed countries and it places a substantial burden on healthcare budgets. Current treatments involving antibiotic dressings and mechanical debridement are often not effective, causing severe pain, emotional distress, and social isolation in patients for years or even decades, ultimately resulting in limb amputation. Alternatively, gene therapy (such as mRNA therapies) has emerged as a viable option to promote wound healing through modulation of gene expression. However, protecting the genetic cargo from degradation and efficient transfection into primary cells remain significant challenges in the push to clinical translation. Another limiting aspect of current therapies is the lack of sustained release of drugs to match the therapeutic window. Herein, we have developed an injectable, biodegradable and cytocompatible hydrogel-based wound dressing that delivers poly(beta-amino ester)s (pBAEs) nanoparticles in a sustained manner over a range of therapeutic windows. We also demonstrate that pBAE nanoparticles, successfully used in previous in vivo studies, protect the mRNA load and efficiently transfect human dermal fibroblasts upon sustained release from the hydrogel wound dressing. This prototype wound dressing technology can enable the development of novel gene therapies for the treatment of chronic wounds.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2021 Sep 13,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c00159,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34081451/,
33956434,"Enhanced Electroactivity, Mechanical Properties, and Printability through the Addition of Graphene Oxide to Photo-Cross-linkable Gelatin Methacryloyl Hydrogel.","The human tissues most sensitive to electrical activity such as neural and muscle tissues are relatively soft, and yet traditional conductive materials used to interface with them are typically stiffer by many orders of magnitude. Overcoming this mismatch, by creating both very soft and electroactive materials, is a major challenge in bioelectronics and biomaterials science. One strategy is to imbue soft materials, such as hydrogels, with electroactive properties by adding small amounts of highly conductive nanomaterials. However, electroactive hydrogels reported to date have required relatively large volume fractions (>1%) of added nanomaterial, have shown only modest electroactivity, and have not been processable via additive manufacturing to create 3D architectures. Here, we describe the development and characterization of improved biocompatible photo-cross-linkable soft hybrid electroactive hydrogels based on gelatin methacryloyol (GelMA) and large area graphene oxide (GO) flakes, which resolve each of these three limitations. The addition of very small amounts (less than a 0.07% volume fraction) of GO to a 5% w/v GelMA hydrogel resulted in a dramatic ( approximately 35-fold) decrease in the impedance at 1 Hz compared with GelMA alone. The GelMA/GO coated indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode also showed a considerable reduction in the impedance at 1 kHz (down to 170 Omega compared with 340 Omega for the GelMA-coated ITO), while charge injection capacity increased more than 6-fold. We attribute this enhanced electroactivity to the increased electroactive surface area contributed by the GO. Despite this dramatic change in electroactivity, the GelMA/GO composite hydrogels' mechanical properties were only moderately affected. Mechanical properties increased by  approximately 2-fold, and therefore, the hydrogels' desired softness of <4 kPa was retained. Also, we demonstrate how light attenuation through the gel can be used to create a stiffness gradient with the exposed surface of the gel having an elastic modulus of <1.5 kPa. GO addition also enhanced the rheological properties of the GelMA composites, thus facilitating 3D extrusion printing. GelMA/GO enhanced filament formation as well as improved printability and the shape fidelity/integrity of 3D printed structures compared with GelMA alone. Additionally, the GelMA/GO 3D printed structures presented a higher electroactive behavior than nonprinted samples containing the same GelMA/GO amount, which can be attributed to the higher electroactive surface area of 3D printed structures. These findings provide new rational choices of electroactive hydrogel (EAH) compositions with broad potential applications in bioelectronics, tissue engineering, and drug delivery.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2021 Jun 14,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c01734,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33956434/,
33463187,Injectable and Cytocompatible Dual Cross-Linking Hydrogels with Enhanced Mechanical Strength and Stability.,"Injectable hydrogels have become increasingly important in the fields of tissue engineering and drug delivery. However, their biological applications are greatly limited by the weak mechanics and poor stability under a physiological environment. Herein, we developed a stable, strong, and injectable hydrogel by linking strong micelle cross-linking with tetra-armed PEG. This dual cross-linking strategy has not only made hydrogels nonswelling but also maintained the relative integrity of the gel network during the degradation process, both of which work together to ensure the mechanical strength and stability of our hydrogel under a physiological environment. A compressive stress of 40 MPa was achieved at 95% strain, and the mechanical properties could remain stable even after immersion into a physiological environment for two months. Besides, it also showed outstanding antifatigue properties, good tissue adhesion, and good cytocompatibility. On the basis of these characteristics, these dual cross-linking injectable hydrogels would find appealing application in biomedicine especially for the repair of load-bearing soft tissues.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2020 Jun 8,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00416,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33463187/,
33405670,Smart Microneedle Fabricated with Silk Fibroin Combined Semi-interpenetrating Network Hydrogel for Glucose-Responsive Insulin Delivery.,"Microneedle (MN) technology, which can transdermally deliver insulin in a noninvasive manner, offers a promising way to replace subcutaneous self-injection for diabetes management. Hydrogel is an attractive candidate for MN fabrication because of its biocompatibility, controllable degradability, and possibility to achieve sustained as well as stimuli-responsive drug delivery. Herein, we report a smart MN composed of a semi-interpenetrating network (semi-IPN) hydrogel prepared by biocompatible silk fibroin (SF) and phenylboronic acid/acrylamide for glucose-responsive insulin delivery. Six fabrication methods were investigated to maintain the glucose sensitivity of the hydrogel while avoiding deformation during fabrication. The optimized method was to fabricate smart MNs using a two-layer strategy, with a needle region formed by the SF combined semi-IPN hydrogel and the base layer fabricated by SF. The hybrid MN autonomously released insulin well-correspondent to the glucose change pattern via the regulation of the skin layer formed on the surface. Furthermore, this hybrid MN retained its original needle shape after 1 week in aqueous system, thus eliminating the safety concerns associated with dissolving MNs and suggesting the possibility for sustained delivery. This nondegradable smart MN is promising to provide on-demand insulin in a long-acting, painless, and convenient way.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2019 Nov 11,Journal Article,10.1021/acsbiomaterials.9b00532,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33405670/,
33435033,Fabrication of Amyloid Curli Fibers-Alginate Nanocomposite Hydrogels with Enhanced Stiffness.,"Alginate hydrogels are biocompatible, biodegradable, low-cost, and widely used as bioinks, cell encapsulates, three-dimensional culture matrices, drug delivery systems, and scaffolds for tissue engineering. Nevertheless, their limited stiffness hinders their use for certain biomedical applications. Many research groups have tried to address this problem by reinforcing alginate hydrogels with graphene, carbon nanotubes, or silver nanoparticles. However, these materials present nanotoxicity issues, limiting their use for biomedical applications. Other studies show that electrospinning or wet spinning can be used to fabricate biocompatible, micro- and nanofibers to reinforce hydrogels. As a relatively simple and cheap alternative, in this study we used bioengineered bacteria to fabricate amyloid curli fibers to enhance the stiffness of alginate hydrogels. We have fabricated for the first time bioengineered amyloid curli fibers-hydrogel composites and characterized them by a combination of (i) atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure the Young's modulus of the bioengineered amyloid curli fibers and study their topography, (ii) nanoindentation to measure the Young's modulus of the amyloid curli fibers-alginate nanocomposite hydrogels, and (iii) Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to analyze their composition. The fabricated nanocomposites resulted in a highly improved Young's modulus (up to 4-fold) and showed very similar physical and chemical properties, opening the window for their use in applications where the properties alginate hydrogels are convenient but do not match the stiffness needed.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2018 Jun 11,Journal Article,10.1021/acsbiomaterials.8b00364,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33435033/,
33445379,"Injectable, Self-Healing Chimeric Catechol-Fe(III) Hydrogel for Localized Combination Cancer Therapy.","Conventional intravenous or oral administration of a combination of chemotherapeutics displays poor bioavailability and induces undesirable systemic toxicity. Therefore, localized delivery of such chemotherapeutic combinations using polymeric hydrogels is expected to help in enhancing drug efficacy and reducing systemic toxicity. In this manuscript, we have utilized a chitosan-catechol based hydrogel (CAT-Gel) assembled through catechol-Fe(III) coordinative interactions for localized combination therapy in murine lung and breast cancer models. CAT-Gel offers a unique blend of material properties such as injectability and self-healing along with useful biological attributes like their noncytotoxic and nonhemolytic nature. The amphipathic nature of this hydrogel enabled us to incorporate a recipe of hydrophilic doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) and hydrophobic docetaxel (DTX) anticancer drugs. Rheology studies confirmed the self-healing nature of this chimeric hydrogel even after drug loading. CAT-Gel was retained for more than 40 days in mice upon subcutaneous injection. The sequential and sustained release of the entrapped DOX and DTX from the hydrogel resulted in synergistic therapeutic effect with increased median survival against murine lung and breast cancer models. Therefore, CAT-Gel provides a new coordinatively assembled biocompatible scaffold for localized delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2017 Dec 11,Journal Article,10.1021/acsbiomaterials.7b00741,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33445379/,

Here, we report on the free-form printing of silk-based, 3D microstructures through multiphoton lithography. Utilizing multiphoton lithography in conjunction with specific photoinitiator chemistry and postprint cross-linking, a number of microarchitectures were achieved including self-supporting fibroin arches.

33429674,Tailoring Stimuli Responsiveness using Dynamic Covalent Cross-Linking of Poly(vinyl alcohol)-Heparin Hydrogels for Controlled Cell and Growth Factor Delivery.,"Heparin-based hydrogels are attractive for cell encapsulation and drug delivery because of the ability of heparin to bind native proteins. However, heparin-based hydrogels have received little attention for their potential as stimuli-sensitive materials. Biosynthetic, poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-heparin hydrogels were formed using dynamic, covalent cross-linking. Hydrogel stimuli-sensitivity was tailored by tuning the concentration of heparin to PVA. Relatively thermally and pH stable hydrogels were produced when formed from only the synthetic, nonionic PVA polymer cross-linked via hydrazone bonds. Cross-linking in the ionic biopolymer heparin, to form PVA-heparin gels, has a profound impact on thermal stability, with degradation ranging from over 6 months to only 4 days across 25-50  degrees C. PVA-heparin hydrogels degrade within 18 days at basic pH (10), while not fully degrading over 6 months at lower pH (4, 7.4). This finding is attributed to the anionic repulsion of carboxyls and sulfates in heparin. PVA-heparin macromers were cytocompatible and enabled mild cell encapsulation, in addition to providing pH-controlled growth factor release. Overall, it is demonstrated that the biopolymer heparin can be used to create pH and temperature-responsive hydrogel biomaterials for cell and drug delivery.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2015 Dec 14,Journal Article,10.1021/acsbiomaterials.5b00321,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33429674/,
