39359103,Local Sustained Dinutuximab Delivery and Release From Methacrylated Chondroitin Sulfate.,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common pediatric extracranial solid tumor. High-risk NB is a subset of the disease that has poor prognosis and requires multimodal treatment regimens, with a 50% rate of recurrence despite intervention. There is a need for improved treatment strategies to reduce high-risk patient mortality. Dinutuximab is an anti-GD2 antibody ideal for targeting GD2 expressing NB cells, but binding of the antibody to peripheral nerve fibers leads to severe pain during systemic administration. Intratumoral delivery of the anti-GD2 antibody would allow for increased local antibody concentration, without increasing systemic toxicity. Chondroitin Sulfate (CS) is a biocompatible glycosaminoglycan that can be methacrylated to form CSMA, a photocrosslinkable hydrogel that can be loaded with therapeutic agents. The methacrylation reaction time can be varied to achieve different degrees of substitution, resulting in different release and degradation profiles. In this work, 4 and 24 h reacted CSMA was used to create hydrogels at 10% and 20% CSMA. Sustained in vitro release of dinutuximab from these formulations was observed over a 24-day period, and 4 h reacted 10% CSMA hydrogels had the highest overall dinutuximab release over time. An orthotropic mouse model was used to evaluate in vivo response to dinutuximab loaded 4 h methacrylated 10% CSMA hydrogels as compared to bolus tail vein injections. Tumor growth was monitored, and there was a statistically significant increase in the days to reach specific tumor size for tumors treated with intratumoral dinutuximab-loaded hydrogel compared to those treated with dinutuximab solution through tail vein injection. This supports the concept that locally delivering dinutuximab within the hydrogel formulation slowed tumor growth. The CSMA hydrogel-only treatment slowed tumor growth as well, an interesting effect that may indicate interactions between the CSMA and cell adhesion molecules in the tumor microenvironment. These findings demonstrate a potential avenue for local sustained delivery of dinutuximab for improved anti-tumoral response in high-risk NB.",Journal of biomedical materials research.

31971330,Self-healing injectable gelatin hydrogels for localized therapeutic cell delivery.,"Self-healing injectable hydrogel biomaterials uniquely enable precise therapeutic deposition and deployment at specific bodily locations through versatile and minimally invasive processes that can preserve cargo integrity and cell viability. Despite the distinct advantages that injectable hydrogels offer in tissue engineering and therapeutic delivery, exceptionally few have been created using components naturally present in the cellular niche. In this work, we introduce a shear-thinning hydrogel based on guest-host complexation of gelatin. As a biocompatible, biodegradable, and nonimmunogenic biopolymer derived from the most abundant extracellular matrix protein (collagen), gelatin offers great utility as the structural component of biomaterials. Taking advantage of reversible guest-host interactions between beta-cyclodextrin (CD) and adamantane (AD) on modified gelatins, we report the first strategy to afford a self-healing material based solely on a functionalized extracellular matrix protein. By varying the initial material formulation, hydrogels were synthesized with variable moduli and shear-thinability across a broad range. Gels were demonstrated to exhibit shear-thinning and self-healing properties, supporting protection of clinically relevant stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes during injection. These materials are expected to expand clinical opportunities in cell delivery for in vivo tissue regeneration.",Journal of biomedical materials research.

31702867,Exosome loaded alginate hydrogel promotes tissue regeneration in full-thickness skin wounds: An in vivo study.,"Wound healing is known as one of the most complicated biological processes for injured skin caused by surgical, trauma, burns, or diabetic diseases, which causes a nonfunctioning mass of fibrotic tissue. Recent reports have suggested that exosomes (EXOs) secreted by this type of stem cells may contribute to their paracrine effect. In this study, the EXOs were isolated from the supernatant of cultured adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) via ultracentrifugation and filtration. The EXO loaded in the alginate-based hydrogel was used as a bioactive scaffold to preserve the EXO in the wound site in the animal model. The physical and biochemical properties of EXO loaded Alg hydrogel were characterized and results proved that fabricated structure was biodegradable and biocompatible. This bioactive wound dressing technique has significantly improved wound closure, collagen synthesis, and vessel formation in the wound area. Results offer a new viewpoint and a cell-free therapeutic strategy, for wound healing through the application of the composite structure of EXO encapsulated in alginate hydrogel.",Journal of biomedical materials research.

28984081,One pot synthesis of new poly(vinyl alcohol) blended natural polymer based magnetic hydrogel beads: Controlled natural anticancer alkaloid delivery system.,"Facile one-pot synthesis has been demonstrated for new biocompatible and dual responsive magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) blended natural polymer chitosan (CS) based hydrogel beads (mCS-PVA) as a controlled natural anticancer alkaloid Luotonin A (LuA) delivery system. The prepared magnetic hydrogel beads were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction measurement, Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and vibrating sample magnetometer. The magnetic hydrogel beads are exhibited significant water retention and follow the second order kinetic model in swelling study. The swelling ratio of the magnetic gel beads increased by the addition of PVA and showed a maximum swelling ratio of 40.83 +/- 1.01 g/g and follows non-Fickian water transport mechanism. Stimuli responsive mCS and mCS-PVA hydrogel beads functionalized with LuA is demonstrated for controlled release at physiological pH and under magnetic field. The magnetic hydrogel beads show highest LuA releasing efficacy at acidic medium (pH = 5.0) with maximum efficiency of 73.33 +/- 1.44%. This efficacy may also be tuned by altering the external magnetic field as well as the weight percentage (wt %) of polyethylene glycol. It is clearly that the newly produced magnetic hydrogel beads can be served as an effective intestinal LuA delivery system. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

24825292,Effective release of a broad spectrum antibiotic from elastin-like polypeptide-collagen composite.,"Preparation of hydrogels that possess an effective antibiotic release profile and better mechanical properties compared to the traditionally used collagen hydrogels has the potential to minimize post-surgical infections and support wound healing. Toward this goal, we prepared elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)-collagen composite hydrogels that displayed a significantly higher elastic modulus compared to the collagen hydrogels. We then characterized the release behavior of the collagen and ELP-collagen hydrogels loaded with varying dosages (1-5% w/w) of a commonly used broad spectrum antibiotic, doxycycline hyclate. Both collagen and ELP-collagen hydrogels showed a gradual time dependent doxycycline release over a period of 5 days. The ELP-collagen hydrogels, in general, showed a slower release of the doxycycline compared to the collagen hydrogels. The released doxycycline was found to be effective against four bacterial strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus sanguinis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in a dose dependent manner. Combined with their improved mechanical properties, the gradual and effective drug release from the biocompatible ELP-collagen hydrogels shown here may be beneficial for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications.",Journal of biomedical materials research.
