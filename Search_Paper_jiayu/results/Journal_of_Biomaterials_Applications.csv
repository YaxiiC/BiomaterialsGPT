35341363,Injectable metronidazole-eluting gelatin-alginate hydrogels for local treatment of periodontitis.,"Infection of the periodontal pocket presents two major challenges for drug delivery: administration into the periodontal pocket and a high fluid clearance rate in the pocket. The current study aimed to develop and study a novel hydrogel system for delivery of the antibiotic drug metronidazole directly into the periodontal pocket via injection followed by in situ gelation. The natural polymers gelatin and alginate served as basic materials, and their crosslinking using a carbodiimide resulted in a dual hydrogel network. The study focused on the effects of the hydrogel's formulation parameters on the drug release profile and the hydrogel's physical and mechanical properties. A cell viability test was conducted on human fibroblasts. The metronidazole-loaded hydrogels demonstrated a decreasing release rate with time, where most of the drug eluted within 24 h. These hydrogels exhibited fibroblast viability of at least 75% after 24 and 48 h, indicating that they are highly biocompatible. Although the alginate concentration used in this study was relatively low, it had a strong effect on the physical as well as the mechanical properties of the hydrogel. An increase in the alginate concentration increased the crosslinking rate and enabled enhanced entanglement of the 3D structure, resulting in a decrease in the gelation time (less than 10 s) and swelling degree, which are both desired for the studied periodontal application. Increasing the gelatin concentration without changing the crosslinker concentration resulted in significant changes in the physical properties and slight changes in the mechanical properties. Metronidazole incorporation slightly decreased the hydrophilicity of the hydrogel and therefore also its viscosity, and affected the sealing ability and the tensile and compression moduli. The developed hydrogels exhibited controllable mechanical and physical properties, can target a wide range of conditions, and are therefore of high significance in the field of periodontal treatment.",Journal of biomaterials applications,2022 Jul,Journal Article,10.1177/08853282221079458,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35341363/,
33148100,Biocompatibility study of modified injectable hyaluronic acid hydrogel with mannitol/BSA to alveolar bone cells.,"The quality and quantity of bone are crucial to the success of dental implant treatment. Recently, bone grafting materials have reached some limitations. This study aimed to evaluate the biocompatibility of novel drug delivery material, injectable methacrylated hyaluronic acid hydrogel incorporated with different ratios of mannitol and BSA (Man/BSA MeHA), to human alveolar bone cells. The three-dimensionally encapsulated cell culture was evaluated with the resazurin cell viability test, alkaline phosphatase activity assay, immunohistochemistry test for collagen type-I synthesis, and cell morphology. The results showed that the encapsulated cells were viable in all four ratios of Man/BSA MeHA hydrogel and the average metabolic rate was not less than the control group. The morphology test showed round shape cells at the upper portion of the hydrogel and fibroblast-like or polygonal shape at the lower portion of hydrogel next to the culture plate. All four groups could express enzyme alkaline phosphatase and collagen type-I. In conclusion, four ratios of Man/BSA MeHA hydrogel were biocompatible with primary human alveolar bone cells.",Journal of biomaterials applications,2021 May,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1177/0885328220971746,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33148100/,
23900448,"Investigation of soy protein hydrogels for biomedical applications: materials characterization, drug release, and biocompatibility.","Soy protein is emerging as a novel material for biomedical applications due to its abundance in nature, ease of isolation and processing, and inherent properties for mediating cell adhesion and growth. In this study, mechanically robust soy protein hydrogels were fabricated with varying weight percentages in water (15, 18, and 20 wt.%) without the use of chemical modifiers or crosslinkers. This fabrication method is beneficial because it allows for the direct injection of these soy hydrogels in vivo. The material properties, drug releasing capability, and biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo were assessed. The different concentrations of soy protein varied the rheological, swelling, and mechanical properties and affected the release of the model drug fluorescein from the hydrogels in vitro. Higher weight percent of soy increased the robustness of the hydrogels and released a lower amount of fluorescein over one week. Viability and growth of seeded L929 mouse fibroblasts demonstrated that the hydrogels were biocompatible in vitro for one week. Soy hydrogels were injectable in vivo into the subcutaneous pocket of mice, and histological staining showed minimal fibrous capsule formation for up to 20 days. The ease of fabrication and tailorable properties of soy hydrogels render it a promising biomaterial for tissue engineering and drug delivery applications, particularly for wound healing.",Journal of biomaterials applications,2014 Mar,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",10.1177/0885328213497413,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23900448/,
