39079184,"Facile preparation of a pH-sensitive biocompatible nanocarrier based on magnetic layered double hydroxides/Cu MOFs-chitosan crosslinked small ka, Cyrillic-carrageenan for controlled doxorubicin delivery to breast cancer cells.","Recently, the biocompatibility of hydrogel nanoparticles has gained considerable research attention in the field of drug delivery. In this regard, we design a pH-controlled nanocarrier based on magnetic layered double hydroxides/copper metal-organic framework-chitosan crosslinked small ka, Cyrillic-carrageenan hydrogel nanoparticles (LDH-Fe(3)O(4)/Cu MOF-DOX-CS@CAR) for targeted release from DOX to breast cancer cells. FT-IR, EDX, XRD, FE-SEM, VSM, and Zeta potential investigated the chemical structure of hydrogel nanoparticles. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading capacity of the DOX were obtained to be 96.1 % and 9.6 %, respectively. The cumulative release of DOX from LDH-Fe(3)O(4)/Cu MOF-DOX-CS@CAR at pH 5.5 and 7.4 after 72 h was 60.3 % and 22.6 %, respectively. These in vitro release results confirmed the controlled release and pH-response behavior of hydrogel nanoparticles. Also, the mechanism of DOX release from LDH-Fe(3)O(4)/Cu MOF-DOX-CS@CAR hydrogel nanoparticles showed that the Korsmeyer-Peppas model with Fickian diffusion is the best-fitting model for describing the release behavior of DOX from hydrogel nanoparticles. The cellular cytotoxicity and DAPI tests of the prepared LDH and LDH-Fe(3)O(4)/Cu MOF toward L929 non-cancerous cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells confirm its relative biocompatibility and safety. Whereas, LDH-Fe(3)O(4)/Cu MOF-DOX-CS@CAR hydrogel nanoparticles toward MCF-7 breast cancer cells had higher cytotoxicity effects due to the targeted and controlled release of DOX to MCF-7 cells. The in vitro DPPH, hemolysis assay, colloidal stability, and enzymatic degradation proved the excellent antioxidant activity (71.81 %), blood compatibility (less than 5 %), better stability, and biodegradation behavior of hydrogel nanoparticles. On these findings, the present study suggests the potential of the prepared LDH-Fe(3)O(4)/Cu MOF-DOX-CS@CAR hydrogel nanoparticles as a pH-controlled drug delivery system for cancer treatment and various biomedical uses.","Colloids and surfaces.

38815311,Effect and mechanism of natural composite hydrogel from fish scale intercellular matrix on diabetic chronic wound repair.,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease with prolonged low-grade inflammation and impaired cellular function, leading to poor wound healing. The treatment of diabetic wounds remains challenging due to the complex wound microenvironment. In view of the prominence of fish scales in traditional Chinese medicine and their wide application in modern medicine, we isolated the intercellular components in the scales of sea bass, obtained a natural composite hydrogel, fish scales gel (FSG), and applied it to diabetic chronic wounds. FSG was rich in collagen-like proteins, and possessed low-temperature gelation properties. In vitro, FSG was biocompatible and promoted fibroblast proliferation by approximately 40 %, endothelial cell migration by approximately 20 % and activated the M1 macrophages. In addition, FSG restored the function of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells damaged by high glucose. Importantly, FSG normalized the acute inflammatory response to impaired macrophages in a high-glucose microenvironment. Transcriptome analysis implies that this mechanism may involve enhanced cell signaling and cellular communication, improved sensitivity to cytokines, and activation of the TNF signaling pathway. Animal experiments confirmed that FSG significantly improved wound closure by approximately 15 % in diabetic rats, showing similar effects to acute wounds. In conclusion, the regulation of multiple cellular functions by FSG, especially the counterintuitive ability to induce acute inflammation, promoted diabetic wound healing and provides a novel therapeutic strategy for wound repair in diabetic patients.","Colloids and surfaces.

36996632,In situ gelation of thiolated poly(aspartic acid) derivatives through oxidant-free disulfide formation for ophthalmic drug delivery.,"Efficient topical treatment of ocular diseases requires a prolonged residence time of drug formulations. An in situ gelling, mucoadhesive system can provide improved residence time while keeps the installation of the formulation easy and accurate due to its low initial viscosity. We synthesized a two-component, biocompatible water-based liquid formulation showing in situ gelation upon mixing. S-protected, preactivated derivatives of thiolated poly(aspartic acid) (PASP-SS-MNA) were synthesized by coupling the free thiol groups of thiolated poly(aspartic acid) (PASP-SH) with 6-mercaptonicotinic acid (MNA). The amount of protecting groups was 242, 341, and 530 micromol/g depending on the degree of thiolation of PASP. The chemical interaction between PASP-SS-MNA and mucin was proven, indicating the mucoadhesive properties. Disulfide cross-linked hydrogels were formed in situ without an oxidizing agent by mixing the aqueous solutions of PASP-SS-MNA and PASP-SH. The gelation time was controlled between 1 and 6 min, while the storage modulus was as high as 4-16 kPa depending on the composition. Swelling experiments showed that hydrogels with no residual thiol groups are stable in phosphate-buffered saline at pH = 7.4. In contrast, the presence of free thiol groups leads to the dissolution of the hydrogel with a rate depending on the excess of thiol groups. The biological safety of the polymers and MNA was confirmed on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cell line. Furthermore, a prolonged release of ofloxacin was observed at pH = 7.4 compared to a conventional liquid formulation, supporting the potential of the developed biopolymers in ophthalmic drug delivery.","Colloids and surfaces.

36525753,Collagen type Ⅰ-loaded methacrylamide hyaluronic acid hydrogel microneedles alleviate stress urinary incontinence in mice: A novel treatment and prevention strategy.,"Stress urinary incontinence (SUI), a chronic disease with widespread effects and an overall prevalence of up to 46% in adult women, is associated with a heavy disease burden. The clinical treatment for mild to moderate SUI is conservative, such as electrical stimulation and Kegel exercises, but the therapeutic effect is unsatisfactory, so it is imperative to seek new treatment modalities. Hydrogel microneedles (MNs) have been widely used in transdermal drug delivery because of their minimally invasive and highly biocompatible characteristics. Therefore, for the first time, we combined collagen type I with MN technology for the treatment and prevention of mild to moderate SUI.","Colloids and surfaces.

36427407,Novel hydrogel comprising non-ionic copolymer with various concentrations of pharmacologically active bile acids for cellular injectable gel.,"Deoxycholic acid (DCA) is a bile acid capable of forming micelles and modifying the properties of hydrogels. We incorporated DCA in sodium alginate (SA) and poloxamer 407 matrices creating novel DCA-copolymer hydrogel for therapeutic delivery. Hydrogels were assessed for common rheological properties. Biocompatibility and biological effect were examined on various cell lines. Cell viability was determent in normal and various hypoxic conditions, and full mitochondrial bioenergetic parameters were assessed in cell lines in order to illustrate hydrogel effects on survival, and cell metabolic profile within the hydrogels. Obtained data suggest that a low dose of DCA in permeable, biocompatible hydrogels can be beneficial for cells to combat hypoxic conditions.","Colloids and surfaces.

31759777,Controlled released of drug from doubled-walled PVA hydrogel/PCL microspheres prepared by single needle electrospraying method.,"Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogels have been extensively studied as drug delivery systems. However, due to the high hydrophilicity of PVA, these hydrogels have weak abilities to efficiently load drugs and control the initial burst release. In this study, we present a one-step simple and rapid single needle electrospraying (SNESy) method that combines PVA hydrogels with another biocompatible polymer polycaprolactone (PCL). A distinct core-shell structure was obtained with the PVA hydrogel core and PCL shell after the system was properly set up. The results revealed that the volume ratio between PVA hydrogel and PCL played an important role in determining the particle size and the formation of a spherical structure. The double-walled structure of the microsphere was confirmed by taking the fluorescent images and conducting the ATR-FTIR method. Furthermore, doxorubicin hydrochloride was used as a model drug to evaluate the drug loading capacity and the in vitro release behavior of this PVA hydrogel/PCL microsphere. The results indicated that coating a layer of PCL polymer significantly enhanced the drug loading capacity and reduced the drug initial burst release compared to the single-layer PVA hydrogel nanoparticles, demonstrating these biocompatible double-walled microspheres can be applied as excellent drug delivery carriers.","Colloids and surfaces.

30517904,Magnetically-propelled hydrogel particle motors produced by ultrasound assisted hydrodynamic electrospray ionization jetting.,"One of the most promising future applications of hydrogels is drug delivery. The hydrogels act as a biomedical cargo model to reach the target and release drugs to cure diseases. This application requires no side effects of the hydrogel and the ability to pass through porous media (e.g. membranes, interstitial tissue etc.) with nanoscaled channels. At the same time, the hydrogel must be mass-producible in an economic way. In this work, we show that hydrodynamic electrospray ionization jetting combined with ultrasound can fulfill these high requirements. This method can produce mucoadhesive micro-/nano-particles, which are small enough to pass through the gastrointestinal epithelium. The average size of the produced particles is exactly predictable by controlling the spraying distance, spraying mode, alginate concentration, ultrasound bath frequency and counter electrode shape. These micro-/nano-particles are loaded with biocompatible magnetite nanoparticles, and propelled by a rotating magnetic field between 5 to 20 m T and a frequency from 1 Hz to 100 Hz. These rotating micro-/nano-particle motors perform directional motion in solution, offering a promising possibility for magnetically controlled drug delivery.","Colloids and surfaces.

30497010,Immunofunctional photodegradable poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel surfaces for the capture and release of rare cells.,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) play a central role in cancer metastasis and represent a rich source of data for cancer prognostics and therapeutic guidance. Reliable CTC recovery from whole blood therefore promises a less invasive and more sensitive approach to cancer diagnosis and progression tracking. CTCs, however, are exceedingly rare in whole blood, making their quantitative recovery challenging. Several techniques capable of isolating these rare cells have been introduced and validated, yet most suffer from low CTC purity or viability, both of which are essential to develop a clinically viable CTC isolation platform. To address these limitations, we introduce a patterned, immunofunctional, photodegradable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogel capture surface for the isolation and selective release of rare cell populations. Flat and herringbone capture surfaces were successfully patterned via PDMS micromolding and photopolymerization of photolabile PEG hydrogels. Patterned herringbone surfaces, designed to convectively transport cells to the capture surface, exhibited improved capture density relative to flat surfaces for target cell capture from buffer, buffy coat, and whole blood. Uniquely, captured cells were released for collection by degrading the hydrogel capture surface with either bulk or targeted irradiation with cytocompatible doses of long wavelength UV light. Recovered cells remained viable following capture and release and exhibited similar growth rates as untreated control cells. The implementation of molded photodegradable PEG hydrogels as a CTC capture surface provides a micropatternable, cytocompatible platform that imparts the unique ability to recover pure, viable CTC samples by selectively releasing target cells.","Colloids and surfaces.

30384275,Cefuroxime conjugated chitosan hydrogel for treatment of wound infections.,"Hydrogels are excellent drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic wound infections. However, the problem of high burst release still remains a challenge that needs to be tackled. In terms of antibiotic release from the hydrogels, as the drug payload depletes it could act as a substrate for bacterial seeding which can create a life-threatening condition. Therefore, to provide the sustained effect of an antibiotic at the localized site via hydrogel matrix, we prepared a chitosan (CS) hydrogel system in which cefuroxime (CEF) is covalently conjugated with chitosan polymer via an ester linkage. To prepare the cefuroxime conjugated chitosan hydrogel, the formulations were optimized using different concentrations of cefuroxime, 0% (CS/CEF_0), 5% (CS/CEF_5), 10% (CS/CEF_10) and 20% (CS/CEF_20) w/w of chitosan. Fourier Transform Infra-red Spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed the conjugation of cefuroxime and chitosan. The drug release studies showed that the release of cefuroxime was higher in the phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with esterase enzyme and alkaline medium (pH 10) compared to phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) alone. Hemolysis assay was performed to demonstrate the hemocompatibility of the prepared hydrogel samples. The cell viability study using the L929 fibroblast and MG63 osteosarcoma cell lines revealed that synthesized hydrogel is biocompatible. Furthermore, a potent antibacterial activity for the extended time period proved the biological efficacy of a hydrolyzed cefuroxime. Thus, CS/CEF_5, CS/CEF_10, and CS/CEF_20 hydrogels have a promising future in the treatment of chronic wound infections.","Colloids and surfaces.

29879635,Characterizations of hyaluronate-based terpolymeric hydrogel synthesized via free radical polymerization mechanism for biomedical applications.,"In the present study, a novel terpolymeric hydrogel was developed using sodium hyaluronate (HA), 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (2-HEA), and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) via free radical polymerization for biomedical applications. To achieve elasticity, swelling ability, porous architecture and sufficient gel strength, hyaluronate was chemically modified by grafting and crosslinking methods using 2-HEA and PEGDA, respectively. The structure and compositions of the fabricated terpolymer (HA-g-p(2-HEA)-x-PEGDA) were verified by FTIR, (1)H HR-MAS-NMR, and TGA analyses. The surface morphology and cross-section of the hydrogel was detected by SEM analysis. The gel nature of terpolymer in aqueous medium at 37  degrees C was confirmed from swelling study, and rheological experiment. Non-cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of the HA-g-p(2-HEA)-x-PEGDA hydrogel were ascertained by in vitro mouse osteoblastic cells (MC3T3) proliferation, and viability studies. Hematoxylin and eosin Y, and Masson's trichrome stainings were performed to show tissue regeneration ability on the prepared hydrogel. In vitro release results of proangiogenic drug-dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), and antibiotics-tetracycline (TCN) showed sustained release behaviour from the prepared hydrogel under different pHs at 37  degrees C. The mathematical models fitted data imply that both DMOG and TCN release follow first order kinetics, while, the release mechanism is primarily controlled by diffusion as well as erosion process. Finally, the novel biocompatible HA-g-p(2-HEA)-x-PEGDA gel, which showed sustained drugs release, and regeneration ability of extracellular matrix and collagen, could be employed in biomedical applications, especially, for the delivery of DMOG/TCN, and in tissue engineering.","Colloids and surfaces.

27429296,Sustained-release hydrogels of topotecan for retinoblastoma.,"Treatment of retinoblastoma, the most common primary ocular malignancy in children, has greatly improved over the last decade. Still, new devices for chemotherapy are needed to achieve better tumor control. The aim of this project was to develop an ocular drug delivery system for topotecan (TPT) loaded in biocompatible hydrogels of poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-poly(ethyleneglycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) block copolymers (PCL-PEG-PCL) for sustained TPT release in the vitreous humor. Hydrogels were prepared from TPT and synthesized PCL-PEG-PCL copolymers. Rheological properties and in vitro and in vivo TPT release were studied. Hydrogel cytotoxicity was evaluated in retinoblastoma cells as a surrogate for efficacy and TPT vitreous pharmacokinetics and systemic as well as ocular toxicity were evaluated in rabbits. The pseudoplastic behavior of the hydrogels makes them suitable for intraocular administration. In vitro release profiles showed a sustained release of TPT from PCL-PEG-PCL up to 7days and drug loading did not affect the release pattern. Blank hydrogels did not affect retinoblastoma cell viability but 0.4% (w/w) TPT-loaded hydrogel was highly cytotoxic for at least 7days. After intravitreal injection, TPT vitreous concentrations were sustained above the pharmacologically active concentration. One month after injection, animals with blank or TPT-loaded hydrogels showed no systemic toxicity or retinal impairment on fundus examination, electroretinographic, and histopathological assessments. These novel TPT-hydrogels can deliver sustained concentrations of active drug into the vitreous with excellent biocompatibility in vivo and pronounced cytotoxic activity in retinoblastoma cells and may become an additional strategy for intraocular retinoblastoma treatment.","Colloids and surfaces.

25797483,Systemic modulation of the stability of pluronic hydrogel by a small amount of graphene oxide.,"Thermo-sensitive and injectable hydrogels have been widely investigated for drug delivery, tissue engineering, and other biomedical applications. Pluronic copolymers can form thermo-sensitive physical gel state, thus applicable for injectable hydrogels. However, they are not stable in vivo, showing a very fast dissolution, which limits their applications. We propose a novel Pluronic-based physical hydrogel with enhanced stability by simply adding a small quantity of graphene oxide (GO) which has a large surface area and can make strong interactions with Pluronic. Further carboxylated GO could act as a more efficient additive. The addition of GO increased the moduli of hydrogels, but more importantly, it enhanced the stability of Pluronic gel dramatically. The in vitro dissolution rate of Pluronic hydrogel could be systematically modulated by increasing GO content. Upon subcutaneous injection at a sol state, GO-containing hydrogel induced a stable gel state, and was maintained over several weeks whereas very fast degradation was observed without the addition of GO. Furthermore, histological analyses demonstrated that the GO-containing Pluronic hydrogel was biocompatible and showed no severe inflammatory response. Similarly, GO-containing hydrogel resulting from the packing of Pluronic-based nanogel also showed the more enhanced stability by the addition of GO both in vitro and in vivo. In both systems, hydrogels with remarkably enhanced stability by the addition of GO were also effective for the sustained release of loaded protein, and the release rates were mainly determined by the degradation rates of hydrogels. Thus, these GO-containing Pluronic systems can be used as a thermo-sensitive injectable system with a sufficient stability in vivo.","Colloids and surfaces.

25444661,Guar gum and sesame oil based novel bigels for controlled drug delivery.,"Bigels are novel semi-solid formulations which have been drawing attention of many research scientists due to their numerous advantages over the conventional gels. The objective of this study was to develop and characterize novel bigels by mixing guar gum hydrogel and sorbitan monostearate-sesame oil based organogel for controlled drug delivery applications. The confocal microscopy suggested the existence of both aqueous and oil phases together as bigel. Micro-scale deformation (viscometric) analysis in conjugation with macro-scale deformation studies suggested shear-thinning and viscoelastic nature of the bigels. Thermal study suggested an increase in thermal stability with the increase in organogel proportion in the bigels. The developed bigels were biocompatible in nature. The in vitro drug release study showed that the release of ciprofloxacin (lipophilic drug) increased with a decrease in the organogel content. Further analysis showed that the drug release from all the bigels followed zero order diffusion kinetics which is desirable for a controlled release system. The drug loaded gels showed good antimicrobial efficiency against Bacillus subtilis. In conclusion, the developed bigels may be tried as matrices for topical drug delivery.","Colloids and surfaces.

25016425,Design of sterile mucoadhesive hydrogels for use in drug delivery: effect of radiation on network structure.,"Radiation induced graft copolymerization is pure, sterile and additive free method for the synthesis of hydrogels for biomedical applications. In the present work, attempt has been made to prepare the biocompatible, mucoadhesive hydrogels based on natural polysaccharide sterculia gum and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for use as drug delivery devices. The effect of gamma radiation on swelling and various network parameters of hydrogels such as the polymer volume fraction in the swollen state (varphi), molecular weight of the polymer chain between two neighboring cross links (M c), crosslink density (rho), and mesh size (xi) have been studied. Hydrogels have been characterized with scanning electron micrographs (SEMs), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction study (XRD), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and swelling studies. Swelling and mesh size decreased while gel strength and crosslink density increased with increase in radiation dose. The swelling of hydrogels and release of drug ciprofloxacin from drug loaded hydrogels occurred through non-Fickian diffusion mechanism. These hydrogels have been observed to have non-thrombogenic, haemo-compatible and mucoadhesive nature and could be used as mucoadhesive drug delivery system to deliver drug to gastro intestinal tract (GIT) in controlled manner.","Colloids and surfaces.
