31621512,Injectable Silk-Based Hydrogel as an Alternative to Cervical Cerclage: A Rabbit Study.,"Background: Preterm birth is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in newborn infants. Cervical insufficiency (CI) is a significant cause of preterm birth. The treatment for CI is cerclage, which is a suture placed around the cervix to provide mechanical support. Cerclage, however, is associated with limited efficacy. Here we present an injectable, silk-based hydrogel as an alternative to cerclage. Objective: Pregnant rabbits were used as an animal model of pregnancy to study the mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and degradation of the hydrogel after cervical injection. Study Design: Silk hydrogel (200 muL volume) was injected into the cervix. Controls were either injected with saline or treated with cerclage (5-0 polyethylene terephthalate suture). To study the effect on mechanical properties, the cervix was tested in compression. Biodegradation of the hydrogel was followed over 6 weeks. For biocompatibility, expression levels of proinflammatory mediators were studied. Results: Hydrogel injection resulted in significant tissue augmentation-the cross-sectional area of the cervix increased 46.3 +/- 3.0%. The modulus of the uninjected and hydrogel-injected tissues was 3.3 +/- 0.7 and 3.2 +/- 0.5 kPa at 5-10% strain, respectively (p = 0.8). Histology showed a mild inflammatory response surrounding the hydrogel. Biodegradation of the hydrogel showed 70% volume loss over 6 weeks. Hydrogel-injected tissue showed similar inflammatory response compared with cerclage. Conclusions: In pregnant rabbits, cervical injection of the silk-based hydrogel was biocompatible and naturally degraded. No adverse effects on timing of delivery and pup viability were seen. Silk-based hydrogels show promise for tissue augmentation during pregnancy. Impact Statement This research describes the use of injectable silk-based hydrogel for augmenting cervical tissue in vivo in a pregnant rabbit model. Further preclinical development of the methods and insights described in this article can lead to therapeutic use of this hydrogel as an alternative to cerclage in preterm birth due to cervical insufficiency.",Tissue engineering.

30632466,Three-Dimensional Culture of Salivary Gland Stem Cell in Orthotropic Decellularized Extracellular Matrix Hydrogels.,"Radiotherapy in patients with cancer can kill cancer cells but also damage normal cells or tissues. During the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer or thyroid cancer, hyposalivation is a representative chronic side effect of radio-damaged salivary glands (SGs). The major symptom of hyposalivation is mouth dryness, resulting in several subsequent long-term complications. No effective therapeutic approaches have been developed to manage this symptom. In this study, we developed the first rat SG tissue-derived decellularized extracellular matrix hydrogel (DSGM-hydrogel) as a functional orthotropic bioscaffold for future efficient SG stem cell therapy. DSGM-hydrogels were characterized by rheological or biochemical analyses, and rat SG stem/progenitor cells (rSGSCs) were then subjected to three-dimensional culture in the DSGM-hydrogels. Interestingly, DSGM-hydrogel-embedded rSGSCs survived and expressed SG functional differentiation marker of amylase IA and increased enzyme activity of alpha-amylase in protein level, whereas they showed reduced levels of adult ductal stem/progenitor markers, including c-Kit, c-Met, and CD44. Furthermore, the expression levels of basic epithelial tight junction markers were recovered to levels similar to those naked SG tissues after culture in DSGM-hydrogels in transcription level. Therefore, our findings suggested that the DSGM-hydrogels could provide an appropriate microenvironment for stem/progenitor cell survival and a source of SG cytodifferentiation. This approach could be an applicable method to SG stem cell research as a potential source for an organoid and for clinical regenerative reagents to manage radio-damaged SGs in vivo. Impact Statement In this study, we established the first rat salivary gland (SG) tissue-derived decellularized extracellular matrix hydrogel (DSGM-hydrogel) and assessed the role of this hydrogel as a functional orthotropic bioscaffold. Our findings provide important insights into the applications of the DSGM-hydrogel as a biocompatible matrix for regenerative therapy of radio-damaged SGs.",Tissue engineering.

30152718,Therapeutic Effect of Controlled Release of Dual Growth Factor Using Heparin-Pluronic Hydrogel/Gelatin-Poly (Ethylene Glycol)-Tyramine Hydrogel System in a Rat Model of Cavernous Nerve Injury.,"The number of cases of erectile dysfunction (ED) caused after radical prostatectomy (RP) prostate cancer treatment is increasing steadily. Although various studies have been conducted for treatment of post-RP ED, there is still a need for more effective methods. A dual growth factor incorporated heparin-pluronic/gelatin-poly(ethylene glycol)-tyramine (HP/GPT) hydrogel, which consists of a basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-loaded HP hydrogel and nerve growth factor (NGF)-loaded GPT hydrogel, can control dose and rate of growth factor release. In this study, we demonstrated that dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT hydrogel could further improve erectile function in a rat model of bilateral cavernous nerve injury (BCNI). We showed that erectile function was decreased after BCNI, but it was further improved by treatment with a dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT hydrogel compared with groups treated with single growth factor in a rat model of cavernous nerve injury. Also, we observed an increase in cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in the dual growth factor group when compared with the groups treated with single growth factor. This effect was associated with greater upregulation of nitric oxide synthase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression in the penile tissue of the group treated with dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT than in the other experimental groups. Apoptosis in the penile tissue treated with the dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT hydrogel was lower than those treated singly with either bFGF or NGF incorporated GPT hydrogel. Both alpha-smooth muscle actin and CD31 expression increased in the group treated with dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT hydrogel when compared to in the other experimental groups. Altogether, our results proved that the sequential and continuous release of growth factors from dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT hydrogel prevented fibrosis and nerve damage induced by BCNI in the corpus cavernosum, and promoted the recovery of erectile function. Dual growth factor incorporated HP/GPT hydrogel may be a potent clinical application for the treatment of post-RP ED and could potentially be used various biomedical application in tissue regnerative medicine.",Tissue engineering.

27019285,Electrospun Microfiber Scaffolds with Anti-Inflammatory Tributanoylated N-Acetyl-d-Glucosamine Promote Cartilage Regeneration.,"Tissue-engineering strategies offer promising tools for repairing cartilage damage; however, these strategies suffer from limitations under pathological conditions. As a model disease for these types of nonideal systems, the inflammatory environment in an osteoarthritic (OA) joint limits the efficacy of engineered therapeutics by disrupting joint homeostasis and reducing its capacity for regeneration. In this work, we investigated a sugar-based drug candidate, a tributanoylated N-acetyl-d-glucosamine analogue, called 3,4,6-O-Bu3GlcNAc, that is known to reduce nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) signaling in osteoarthritis. 3,4,6-O-Bu3GlcNAc not only inhibited NFkappaB signaling but also exerted chondrogenic and anti-inflammatory effects on chondrocytes isolated from patients with osteoarthritis. 3,4,6-O-Bu3GlcNAc also increased the expression of extracellular matrix proteins and induced cartilage tissue production in three-dimensional in vitro hydrogel culture systems. To translate these chondrogenic and anti-inflammatory properties to tissue regeneration in osteoarthritis, we implanted 3,4,6-O-Bu3GlcNAc-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microfiber scaffolds into rats. The drug-laden scaffolds were biocompatible, and when seeded with human OA chondrocytes, similarly promoted cartilage tissue formation. 3,4,6-O-Bu3GlcNAc combined with the appropriate structural environment could be a promising therapeutic approach for osteoarthritis.",Tissue engineering.

25625433,Optimization of an injectable tendon hydrogel: the effects of platelet-rich plasma and adipose-derived stem cells on tendon healing in vivo.,"INTRODUCTION: Acute and chronic tendon injuries would benefit from stronger and more expeditious healing. We hypothesize that supplementation of a biocompatible tendon hydrogel with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) would augment the tendon healing process. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using 55 Wistar rats, a full-thickness defect was created within the midsubstance of each Achilles tendon with the addition of one of five experimental conditions: (i) saline control (50-muL), (ii) tendon hydrogel (50-muL), (iii) tendon hydrogel (45-muL)+PRP (5-muL), (iv) tendon hydrogel (45-muL)+2x10(6)-ASCs/mL in phosphate buffered saline (5-muL), and (v) tendon hydrogel (45-muL)+2x10(6)-ASCs/mL in PRP (5-muL). Hydrogel was developed from decellularized, human cadaveric tendons. Fresh rat PRP was obtained per Amable et al.'s technique, and green fluorescent protein/luciferase-positive rat ASCs were utilized. Rats were sacrificed at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8 after injury. Real-time in vivo bioluminescence imaging of groups with ASCs was performed. Upon sacrifice, Achilles tendons underwent biomechanical and histological evaluation. Comparisons across groups were analyzed using the two-sample Z-test for proportions and the Student's t-test for independent samples. Significance was set at p<0.05. RESULTS: (i) Bioluminescence imaging demonstrated that total photon flux was significantly increased for hydrogel+PRP+ASCs, versus hydrogel+ASCs for each postoperative day imaged (p<0.03). (ii) Mean ultimate failure load (UFL) was increased for hydrogel augmented with PRP and/or ASCs versus hydrogel alone at week 2 (p<0.03). By week 4, hydrogel alone reached a similar mean UFL to hydrogel augmented with PRP and/or ASCs (p>0.3). However, at week 8, hydrogel with PRP and ASCs demonstrated increased strength over other groups (p<0.05), except for hydrogel with PRP (p=0.25). (iii) Upon histological analysis, Hematoxylin and Eosin staining showed increased extracellular matrix formation in groups containing PRP and increased cellularity in groups containing ASCs. Groups containing both PRP and ASCs demonstrated both of these characteristics. CONCLUSION: PRP and ASCs are easily accessible bioactive products that have potentiating effects on tendon hydrogel. Augmentation with these two factors encourages earlier mechanical strength and functional restoration. Thus, biochemically, tendon hydrogel augmented with PRP and/or ASCs, serves as a promising therapeutic modality for augmenting the tendon healing process after injury.",Tissue engineering.
