39489016,Ru single-atom nanozymes targeting ROS-ferroptosis pathways for enhanced endometrial regeneration in intrauterine adhesion therapy.,"Intrauterine adhesion (IUA) presents a significant challenge in gynecology, characterized by excessive fibrosis and compromised reproductive function, leading to severe infertility. Although biocompatible hydrogels integrated with stem cells offer a promising approach for IUA therapy, clinical applications remain limited. Recent studies have highlighted the role of ferroptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in IUA pathogenesis, yet strategies targeting ferroptosis through antioxidant stress are underexplored. This study investigates the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of a Ru-Single-Atom Nanozyme (Ru-SAN) incorporated into chitosan hydrogel for treating IUA. Ru-SAN, which mimics the enzyme activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase, effectively clears excess ROS and shows promise in treating oxidative stress-induced diseases. The results demonstrate the superior antioxidative capabilities of Ru-SAN, significantly suppressing the ROS-ferroptosis cycle at the injury site. This creates a favorable microenvironment for post-injury repair by inhibiting inflammation, enhancing mesenchymal-to-epithelial transformation, promoting angiogenesis, and polarizing M2 macrophages. Importantly, it mitigates adverse repair outcomes from inflammation and excessive collagen fiber deposition, ultimately restoring uterine glandular structures and thickness, thereby achieving the ultimate goal of restoring fertility and live birth rates. In conclusion, our study delineates a pioneering therapeutic approach leveraging the antioxidant properties of Ru-SAN to target ferroptosis, thereby offering an efficacious treatment for IUA.",Biomaterials,2025 Apr,Journal Article,S0142-9612(24)00457-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39489016/,
39461063,3D printing incorporating gold nanozymes with mesenchymal stem cell-derived hepatic spheroids for acute liver failure treatment.,"Acute liver failure (ALF) is a highly fatal disease, necessitating the advancement and optimization of alternative therapeutic strategies to benefit patients awaiting liver transplantation. In this study, we innovatively established the antioxidant nanozyme-hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) microtissue sheets (HS/N-Au@composite) for ALF therapy. We first prepared a 3D-printed hyaluronic acid/gelatin/sodium alginate scaffold with N-acetylcysteine (NAC)-capped gold nanoclusters (NAC-Au NCs), forming the N-Au@hydrogel. For the encapsulation of HLC spheroids, we used a biocompatible hybrid hydrogel composed of decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM), thrombin, and fibrinogen, resulting in the HS@dECM hydrogel. Utilizing 3D printing technology, we integrated the N-Au@hydrogel with the HS@dECM hydrogel to create the HS/N-Au@composite for in situ transplantation to treat ALF. Our results demonstrated that NAC-Au NCs effectively mitigated reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced liver necrosis in ALF. Additionally, the N-Au@hydrogel provided mechanical support, ensuring the proper landing and effective functioning of the transplanted HLC spheroids. The HS/N-Au@composite synergistically decreased serum transaminase levels, reduced the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, accelerated liver function recovery, and promoted liver regeneration in ALF treatment. This combination of HLC spheroids and NAC-Au NCs nanozymes via 3D-printed composite scaffolds represents a promising strategy for enhancing hepatocyte transplantation and advancing stem cell regenerative medicine in ALF therapy.",Biomaterials,2025 Apr,Journal Article,S0142-9612(24)00429-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39461063/,
37276796,Structurally dynamic self-healable hydrogel cooperatively inhibits intestinal inflammation and promotes mucosal repair for enhanced ulcerative colitis treatment.,"Hydrogels are a class of biocompatible materials with versatile functions that have been increasing explored for the localized treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), but various mechanical stimuli may cause premature hydrogel breakage and detachment, impeding their further clinical translation. Here we report a multifunctional mechanically-resilient self-healing hydrogel for effective UC treatment, which is synthesized through the host-guest interaction between dopamine/beta-cyclodextrin-modified hyaluronic acid (HA-CD-DA) and amantadine-modified carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS-AD). The excessive beta-CD cavities allow the incorporation of dexamethasone (DEX), while the porous hydrogel network potentiates the encapsulation of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and L-alanyl-l-glutamine (ALG). DA moieties in HA components allow firm adhesion of the hydrogel to the ulcerative lesions after in-situ implantation, while the reversible host-guest interaction between CD and AD could enhance the persistence of hydrogel. The hydrogel demonstrated favorable biocompatibility and could continuously release DEX to induce M1-to-M2 repolarization of mucosal macrophages through inhibiting the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) axis. Furthermore, the co-delivered bFGF and ALG facilitates the regeneration of ulcerative mucosa and restore its barrier functions to ameliorate UC symptoms. The mechanically resilient hydrogel offers an integrative approach for UC therapy in the clinics.",Biomaterials,2023 Aug,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(23)00192-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37276796/,
35390709,Injectable adhesive hemostatic gel with tumor acidity neutralizer and neutrophil extracellular traps lyase for enhancing adoptive NK cell therapy prevents post-resection recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Post-resection recurrence remains an intractable problem in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) management. Natural killer (NK) cell infusion is considered as a promising cancer therapy, but acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) greatly counteract its efficacy. Recently, polymer hydrogels have aroused much interest in tumor combination therapy, since they load and controllably release therapeutic agents with high bioavailability and low systemic toxicity. Therefore, a biocompatible hydrogel with tumor acidity neutralizer and NETs lyase may show promise for enhancing NK infusion to prevent post-resection HCC recurrence. Herein, a dual pH-responsive hydrogel with tumor acidity neutralizer (mesoporous bioactive glass nanoparticles) and NETs lyase (Deoxyribonuclease I, DNase I) is developed and used in combination with NK cell infusion for preventing post-resection HCC recurrence. The hydrogel can be injected to surgical margin and form an adhesive gel with a rapid hemostasis. Besides, it neutralizes tumor acidity to reduce tumor infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, and releases DNase I in a pH-responsive manner to degrade NETs. Moreover, this combination therapy significantly enhances NK cell infusion to combat post-surgical HCC recurrence without systemic toxicity. This study provides proof of concept that combination of NK cell adoptive therapy and hydrogel-based delivery system can successfully prevent post-resection HCC recurrence.",Biomaterials,2022 May,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(22)00145-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35390709/,
34871879,Integrating engineered macro vessels with self-assembled capillaries in 3D implantable tissue for promoting vascular integration in-vivo.,"A functional multi-scale vascular network can promote 3D engineered tissue growth and improve transplantation outcome. In this work, by using a combination of living cells, biological hydrogel, and biodegradable synthetic polymer we fabricated a biocompatible, multi-scale vascular network (MSVT) within thick, implantable engineered tissues. Using a templating technique, macro-vessels were patterned in a 3D biodegradable polymeric scaffold seeded with endothelial and support cells within a collagen gel. The lumen of the macro-vessel was lined with endothelial cells, which further sprouted and anastomosed with the surrounding self-assembled capillaries. Anastomoses between the two-scaled vascular systems displayed tightly bonded cell junctions, as indicated by vascular endothelial cadherin expression. Moreover, MSVT functionality and patency were demonstrated by dextran passage through the interconnected multi-scale vasculature. Additionally, physiological flow conditions were applied with home-designed flow bioreactors, to achieve a MSVT with a natural endothelium structure. Finally, implantation of a multi-scale-vascularized graft in a mouse model resulted in extensive host vessel penetration into the graft and a significant increase in blood perfusion via the engineered vessels compared to control micro-scale-vascularized graft. Designing and fabricating such multi-scale vascular architectures within 3D engineered tissues may benefit both in vitro models and therapeutic translation research.",Biomaterials,2022 Jan,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(21)00643-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34871879/,
34601198,Macrophage-derived implantable vaccine prevents postsurgical tumor recurrence.,"Immunotherapy emerges as a potential therapeutic strategy against tumor relapse. However, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment poses an obstacle to immunotherapy. Of particular note is that macrophages are abundant in solid tumors and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are mainly anti-inflammatory and protumoral. Therefore, re-educating TAMs will be critical for improving the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapy. Herein we engineered a macrophage-derived implantable vaccine for suppressing postsurgical tumor relapse. The vaccine comprised hybrid cytomembranes from macrophages/tumor cells and an immunoadjuvant, cytosinephosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODNs). The vaccine was further embedded into a calcium alginate hydrogel for tissue-localized delivery. Results show that the vaccine could induce the shift from anti-inflammatory M2-like TAMs to proinflammatory M1-like macrophage. Moreover, the vaccine stimulated systemic immunity by facilitating dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and memory T (T EM) cell activation, forming a self-replenishing circulation in tumor microenvironment. Consequently, the vaccine could prevent the postsurgical tumor relapse at both the primary and distant tumor sites. In addition, the lung metastasis was also reduced by the vaccine implantation in mice. The multifunctional vaccine prepared from biomacromolecule and nature-derived material provides a biocompatible and versatile tool for re-educating TAMs and preventing postsurgical tumor recurrence.",Biomaterials,2021 Nov,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(21)00518-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34601198/,
34482087,Fucoidan-functionalized polysaccharide submicroparticles loaded with alteplase for efficient targeted thrombolytic therapy.,"Intravenous administration of fibrinolytic drugs is the standard treatment of acute thrombotic diseases. However, current fibrinolytics exhibit limited clinical efficacy because of their short plasma half-lives and might trigger hemorrhagic transformations. Therefore, it is mandatory to develop innovative nanomedicine-based solutions for more efficient and safer thrombolysis with biocompatible and biodegradable thrombus-targeted nanocarrier. Herein, fucoidan-functionalized hydrogel polysaccharide submicroparticles with high biocompatibility are elaborated by the inverse miniemulsion/crosslinking method. They are loaded with the gold standard fibrinolytic - alteplase - to direct site-specific fibrinolysis due to nanomolar interactions between fucoidan and P-selectin overexpressed on activated platelets and endothelial cells in the thrombus area. The thrombus targeting properties of these particles are validated in a microfluidic assay containing recombinant P-selectin and activated platelets under arterial and venous blood shear rates as well as in vivo. The experiments on the murine model of acute thromboembolic ischemic stroke support this product's therapeutic efficacy, revealing a faster recanalization rate in the middle cerebral artery than with free alteplase, which reduces post-ischemic cerebral infarct lesions and blood-brain barrier permeability. Altogether, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of a biomaterial-based targeted nanomedicine for the precise treatment of acute thrombotic events, such as ischemic stroke.",Biomaterials,2021 Oct,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(21)00458-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34482087/,
34419838,Mechanically matching the rheological properties of brain tissue for drug-delivery in human glioblastoma models.,"Peptide functionalized hyaluronic acid (HA(CF)) cross-linked by cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]), a new class of drug-delivery reservoirs, is used to enable improved drug bioavailability for glioblastoma tumors in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. The mechanical and viscoelastic properties of native human and mouse tissues are measured over 8 h via oscillatory rheology under physiological conditions. Treatment with drug-loaded hydrogels allowed for a significant survival impact of 45 % (55.5-80.5 days). A relationship between the type of PDX tumor formed-a consequence of the heterogeneic nature of GB tumors-and changes in the initial survival is observed owing to greater local pressure from stiffer tumors. These biocompatible and tailorable materials warrant use as drug delivery reservoirs in PDX resection models, where the mechanical properties can be readily adjusted to match the stiffness of local tissue and thus have potential to improve the survival of GB patients.",Biomaterials,2021 Sep,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(21)00275-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34419838/,
33882404,A tunable self-healing ionic hydrogel with microscopic homogeneous conductivity as a cardiac patch for myocardial infarction repair.,"Conductive hydrogel is a potential therapeutic tool to treat damaged heart muscles in myocardial infarction (MI). However, it is still a quite challenge to optimize the fabrication of a therapeutic hydrogel patch that sustains favorable biocompatibility, electronic and mechanical stability under a complicated MI microenvironment. Herein, a tunable self-healing ionic hydrogel (POG(1)) was developed through the introduction of a biocompatible polyacrylic acid (PAA, FDA-approved) into the hydrogel matrix. The fabricated POG(1) hydrogel possessed suitable stretchable (>500% strain) and compressive (>85% strain) properties, comparable modulus with mammalian heart (30-500 kPa, Young's modulus), self-healable, and highly stable conductivity during large deformations (~50% compress strain, ~150% tensile strain). Specifically, the established PAA nano-channels inside of POG(1) endowed the hydrogel with microscopic ultra-homogeneous conductivity. Compared to those seeded in the electronic conductors-embedded (PPy, CNT, rGO) hydrogels, the cardiomyocytes (CMs) seeded in the POG(1) hydrogel exhibited more significantly oriented sarcomeres. This POG(1) engineered cardiac patch (ECP) also exerted robust benefits in attenuating left ventricular remodeling and restoring heart function after implantation in vivo. This paper highlighted a previously unexplored strategy for a biocompatible ionic conductive hydrogel ECP with an excellent MI repair function.",Biomaterials,2021 Jun,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(21)00167-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33882404/,
33676234,3D printing of chemical-empowered tendon stem/progenitor cells for functional tissue repair.,"Tendon injuries are the leading cause of chronic debilitation to patients. Tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) are potential seed cells for tendon tissue engineering and regeneration, but TSPCs are prone to lose their distinct phenotype in vitro and specific differentiation into the tenocyte lineage is challenging. Utilizing small molecules in an ex vivo culture system may be a promising solution and can significantly improve the therapeutic applications of these cells. Here, by using an image-based, high-throughput screening platform on small molecule libraries, this study established an effective stepwise culture strategy for TSPCs application. The study formulated a cocktail of small molecules which effected proliferation, tenogenesis initiation and maturation phases, and significantly upregulated expression of various tendon-related genes and proteins in TSPCs, which were demonstrated by high-throughput PCR, ScxGFP reporter assay and immunocytochemistry. Furthermore, by combining small molecule-based culture system with 3D printing technology, we embedded living, chemical-empowered TSPCs within a biocompatible hydrogel to engineer tendon grafts, and verified their enhanced ability in promoting functional tendon repair and regeneration both in vivo and in situ. The stepwise culture system for TSPCs and construction of engineered tendon grafts can not only serve as a platform for further studies of underlying molecular mechanisms of tenogenic differentiation, but also provide a new strategy for tissue engineering and development of novel therapeutics for clinical applications.",Biomaterials,2021 Apr,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(21)00073-9,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33676234/,
30669015,A new class of biological materials: Cell membrane-derived hydrogel scaffolds.,"Biological materials are superior to synthetic biomaterials in biocompatibility and active interactions with cells. Here, a new class of biological materials, cell membrane-derived hydrogel scaffolds are reported for harnessing these advantages. To form macroporous scaffolds, vesicles derived from red blood cell membranes (RBCMs) are chemically crosslinked via cryogelation. The RBCM scaffolds with a pore size of around 70 mum are soft and injectable. Highly biocompatible scaffolds are typically made of superhydrophilic polymers and lack the ability to encapsulate and release hydrophobic drugs in a controlled manner. However, hydrophobic molecules can be efficiently encapsulated inside RBCM scaffolds and be sustainedly released. RBCM scaffolds show low neutrophil infiltration after subcutaneous injection in mice, and a significantly higher number of infiltrated macrophages than methacrylate alginate (MA-alginate) scaffolds. According to gene expression and surface markers, these macrophages have an M2-like phenotype, which is anti-inflammatory and immune suppressive. There are also higher percentages of macrophages presenting immunosuppressive PD-L1 in RBCM-scaffolds than in MA-alginate scaffolds. Interestingly, the concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10 in both types of scaffolds are higher than those in normal organ tissues. This study sheds light on cell membrane-derived hydrogels, which can actively modulate cells in unique ways unavailable to existing hydrogel scaffolds.",Biomaterials,2019 Mar,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(19)30027-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30669015/,
30468998,Initial cell maturity changes following transplantation in a hyaluronan-based hydrogel and impacts therapeutic success in the stroke-injured rodent brain.,"Ischemic stroke results in a loss of neurons for which there are no available clinical strategies to stimulate regeneration. While preclinical studies have demonstrated that functional recovery can be obtained by transplanting an exogenous source of neural progenitors into the brain, it remains unknown at which stage of neuronal maturity cells will provide the most benefit. We investigated the role of neuronal maturity on cell survival, differentiation, and long-term sensorimotor recovery in stroke-injured rats using a population of human cortically-specified neuroepithelial progenitor cells (cNEPs) delivered in a biocompatible, bioresorbable hyaluronan/methylcellulose hydrogel. We demonstrate that transplantation of immature cNEPs result in the greatest tissue and functional repair, relative to transplantation of more mature neurons. The transplantation process itself resulted in the least cell death and phenotypic changes in the immature cNEPs, and the greatest acute cell death in the mature cells. The latter negatively impacted host tissue and negated any potential positive effects associated with cell maturity and the hydrogel vehicle, which itself showed some functional and tissue benefit. Moreover, we show that more mature cell populations are drastically altered during the transplantation process itself. The phenotype of the cells before and after transplantation had an enormous impact on their survival and the consequent tissue and behavioral response, emphasizing the importance of characterizing injected cells in transplantation studies more broadly.",Biomaterials,2019 Feb,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(18)30797-X,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30468998/,

Constructed from hyaluronic acid, this hydrogel is biocompatible and has a high water content of 98%. The mechanical properties have been characterised by rheology and compared with the modulus of human brain tissue demonstrating the production of a soft material that can be moulded into the cavity it is implanted into following surgical resection. Furthermore, effective delivery of therapeutic compounds and antibodies to primary human glioblastoma cell lines is showcased by a variety of in vitro and ex vivo viability and immunocytochemistry based assays.",Biomaterials,2018 Oct,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(18)30411-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30037456/,
25453967,Genipin-crosslinked catechol-chitosan mucoadhesive hydrogels for buccal drug delivery.,"Drug administration via buccal mucosa is an attractive drug delivery strategy due to good patient compliance, prolonged localized drug effect, and avoidance of gastrointestinal drug metabolism and first-pass elimination. Buccal drug delivery systems need to maintain an intimate contact with the mucosa lining in the wet conditions of the oral cavity for long enough to allow drug release and absorption. For decades, mucoadhesive polymers such as chitosan (CS) and its derivatives have been explored to achieve this. In this study, inspired by the excellent wet adhesion of marine mussel adhesive protein, we developed a buccal drug delivery system using a novel catechol-functionalized CS (Cat-CS) hydrogel. We covalently bonded catechol functional groups to the backbone of CS, and crosslinked the polymer with a non-toxic crosslinker genipin (GP). We achieved two degrees of catechol conjugation (9% and 19%), forming Cat9-CS/GP and Cat19-CS/GP hydrogels, respectively. We confirmed covalent bond formation during the catechol functionalization and GP crosslinking during the gel formation. The gelation time and the mechanical properties of Cat-CS hydrogels are similar to those of CS only hydrogels. Catechol groups significantly enhanced mucoadhesion in vitro (7 out of the 10 Cat19-CS hydrogels were still in contact with porcine mucosal membrane after 6 h, whereas all of the CS hydrogels lost contact after 1.5 h). The new hydrogel systems sustained the release of lidocaine for about 3 h. In-vivo, we compared buccal patches made of Cat19-CS/GP and CS/GP adhered to rabbit buccal mucosa. We were able to detect lidocaine in the rabbit's serum at concentration about 1 ng/ml only from the Cat19-CS patch, most likely due to the intimate contact provided by mucoadhesive Cat19-CS/GP systems. No inflammation was observed on the buccal tissue in contact with any of the patches tested. These results show that the proposed catechol-modified CS hydrogel is a promising mucoadhesive and biocompatible hydrogel system for buccal drug delivery.",Biomaterials,2015 Jan,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(14)01071-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25453967/,
24875761,Preserved bioactivity and tunable release of a SDF1-GPVI bi-specific protein using photo-crosslinked PEGda hydrogels.,"Chemokine-induced stem cell recruitment is a promising strategy for post myocardial infarction treatment. Injection of stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) has been shown to attract bone marrow-derived progenitor cells (BMPCs) from the blood that have the potential to differentiate into cardiovascular cells, which support angiogenesis, enabling the improvement of myocardial function. SDF1-GPVI bi-specific protein contains a glycoprotein VI (GPVI)-domain that serves as an anchor for collagen type I (Col I) and III, which are exposed in the wall of injured vasculature. In this study, we generated a cytocompatible hydrogel via photo-crosslinking of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate that serves as a reservoir for SDF1-GPVI. Controlled and sustained release of SDF1-GPVI was demonstrated over a period of 7 days. Release features were modifiable depending on the degree of the crosslinking density. Functionality of the GPVI-domain was investigated using a GPVI-binding ELISA to Col I. Activity of the SDF1-domain was tested for its CXCR4 binding potential. Preserved functionality of SDF1-GPVI bi-specific protein after photo-crosslinking and controllable release was successfully demonstrated in vitro supporting the implementation of this drug delivery system as a powerful tool for therapeutic protein delivery in the treatment of cardiovascular ischemic disease.",Biomaterials,2014 Aug,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S0142-9612(14)00529-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24875761/,
