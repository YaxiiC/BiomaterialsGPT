39230440,Development and characterization of a novel poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-based thermoresponsive photoink and its applications in DLP bioprinting.,"The field of 3-dimensional (3D) bioprinting has significantly expanded capabilities in producing precision-engineered hydrogel constructs, and recent years have seen the development of various stimuli-responsive bio- and photoinks. There is, however, a distinct lack of digital light processing (DLP)-compatible photoinks with thermoresponsivity. To remedy this, this work focuses on formulating and optimizing a versatile ink for DLP printing of thermoresponsive hydrogels, with numerous potential applications in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and adjacent biomedical fields. Photoink optimization was carried out using a multifactorial study design. The optimized photoink yielded crosslinked hydrogels with strong variations in hydrophobicity (contact angles of 44.4 degrees <LCST, 71.0 degrees  >LCST), indicating marked thermoresponsivity. Mechanical- and rheological characterization of the printed hydrogels showed significant changes above the LCST: storage- and loss moduli both increased and loss tangent and compressive modulus decreased above this temperature (P </= 0.01). The highly cytocompatible hydrogel microwell arrays yielded both single- and multilayer spheroids with human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) and HeLa cells successfully. Evaluation of the release of encapsulated model macro- (bovine serum albumin, BSA) and small molecule (rhodamine B) drugs in a buffer solution showed an interestingly inverted thermoresponsive release profile with >80% release at room temperature and about 50-60% release above the gels' LCST. All told, the optimized ink holds great promise for multiple biomedical applications including precise and high-resolution fabrication of complex tissue structures, development of smart drug delivery systems and 3D cell culture.",Journal of materials chemistry.

39083365,Double-crosslinkable poly(urethane)-based hydrogels relying on supramolecular interactions and light-initiated polymerization: promising tools for advanced applications in drug delivery.,"Physical and chemical hydrogels are promising platforms for tissue engineering/regenerative medicine (TERM). In particular, physical hydrogels are suitable for use in the design of drug delivery systems owing to their reversibility and responsiveness to applied stimuli and external environment. Alternatively, the use of chemical hydrogels represents a better strategy to produce stable 3D constructs in the TERM field. In this work, these two strategies were combined to develop multi-functional formulations integrating both drug delivery potential and TERM approaches in a single device. Specifically, a novel photo-sensitive poly(ether urethane) (PEU) was developed to form supramolecular networks with alpha-cyclodextrins (alpha-CDs). The PEU was successfully synthesized using Poloxamer(R) 407, 1,6-diisocyanatohexane and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, as assessed by infrared spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR) spectroscopy. Subsequently, PEU thermo-responsiveness was characterized through critical micelle temperature evaluation and dynamic light scattering analyses, which suggested the achievement of a good balance between molecular mass and overall hydrophobicity. Consequently, the formation of supramolecular domains with alpha-CDs was demonstrated through X-ray diffraction and (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Supramolecular hydrogels with remarkably fast gelation kinetics (i.e., few minutes) were designed using a low PEU concentration (</=5% w/v). All formulations were found to be cytocompatible according to the ISO 10993-5 regulation. Notably, the hydrogels were observed to possess mechanical properties and self-healing ability, according to rheological tests, and their fast photo-crosslinking was evidenced (<60 s) by photo-rheology. A high curcumin payload (570 mug mL(-1)) was encapsulated in the hydrogels, which was released with highly tunable and progressive kinetics in a physiological-simulated environment for up to 5 weeks. Finally, a preliminary evaluation of hydrogel extrudability was performed using an extrusion-based bioprinter, obtaining 3D-printed structures showing good morphological fidelity to the original design. Overall, the developed hydrogel platform showed promising properties for application in the emerging field of regenerative pharmacology as (i) easily injectable drug-loaded formulations suitable for post-application stabilization through light irradiation, and (ii) biomaterial inks for the fabrication of patient-specific drug-loaded patches.",Journal of materials chemistry.

37234001,Spatiotemporal photo-release of hydrogen sulphide from beta-carboline-derived nanoparticles for therapeutic applications.,"Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is an important gasotransmitter that plays a significant role in the regulation of various physiological activities. The therapeutic effect of H(2)S is highly concentration-dependent and has recently been recognized for wound healing applications. Until now, the reported H(2)S delivery systems for wound healing applications have been focused on polymer-coated cargo systems for the encapsulation of H(2)S donors that are based just on endogenous stimuli-responsive systems such as pH or glutathione. These delivery systems lack spatio-temporal control and can cause premature H(2)S release depending on the wound microenvironment. In this regard, polymer-coated light-activated gasotransmitter donors provide a promising and efficient means of delivering high spatial and temporal control along with localized delivery. Hence, for the first time, we developed a beta-carboline photocage-based H(2)S donor (BCS) and formulated it into two photo-controlled H(2)S delivery systems: (i) Pluronic-coated nanoparticles loaded with BCS (Plu@BCS nano); and (ii) a hydrogel platform impregnated with BCS (Plu@BCS hydrogel). We investigated the mechanism of photo-release and the photo-regulated H(2)S release profile from the BCS photocage. We found that the Plu@BCS nano and Plu@BCS hydrogel systems were stable and did not release H(2)S without light treatment. Interestingly, external light manipulation, such as changing the irradiation wavelength, time, and location, regulate the release of H(2)S precisely. Biological studies (in vitro) suggest that the Pluronic coating on the BCS photocage makes the donor highly biocompatible and desirable for biological applications.",Journal of materials chemistry.

35416225,Responsive hydrogel-based microneedle dressing for diabetic wound healing.,"Wound healing is a critical challenge in diabetic patients, mainly due to long-term dysglycemia and its related pathological complications. Subcutaneous insulin injection represents a typical clinical solution, while the low controllability of insulin administration commonly leads to a result far from the optimal therapeutic effect. In this work, we developed a glucose-responsive insulin-releasing hydrogel for microneedle dressing fabrication and then investigated its effects on diabetic wound healing. The hydrogel system was composed of biocompatible gelatin methacrylate (GelMa), glucose-responsive monomer 4-(2-acrylamidoethylcarbamoyl)-3-fluorophenylboronic acid (AFPBA) and gluconic insulin (G-insulin), and the Gel-AFPBA-ins hydrogel-based microneedle dressing was developed by replicating PDMS molds. The resultant hydrogel microneedle dressing exhibited adequate mechanical properties, high biocompatibility, glucose-responsive insulin release behavior upon exposure to different glucose solutions, and potent adhesion to the skin compared to hydrogels without microstructures. The microneedle dressing could accelerate the diabetic wound healing process with decreased inflammatory reaction, enhanced collagen deposition on the regenerated tissue sites, and improved blood glucose control in animals. Therefore, the glucose-responsive insulin-releasing hydrogel microneedle dressing is effective in diabetic wound management and has potential for treatment of other chronic skin injuries.",Journal of materials chemistry.

34757371,Synthesis and characterization of a novel pH-responsive drug-releasing nanocomposite hydrogel for skin cancer therapy and wound healing.,"Local skin cancer recurrence occurs in  approximately 12% of the patients post-surgery due to persistent growth of residual cancer cells. Wound infection is another significant complication following surgery. We report a novel in situ-forming nanocomposite hydrogel (NCH) containing PLGA-carboxymethyl chitosan nanoparticles (186 nm) for localized pH-responsive skin cancer therapy and wound healing. This injectable hydrogel, comprising of a citric acid-derived polymer backbone, gelled within 5 minutes, and demonstrated excellent swelling (283% of dry weight) and compressive strengths ( approximately 5.34 MPa). Nanoparticle incorporation did not significantly affect hydrogel properties. The NCH effluents were cytocompatible with human dermal fibroblasts at 500 mug ml(-1) concentration and demonstrated pH-dependent drug release and promising therapeutic efficacy against A431 and G361 skin cancer cells in vitro. Significant zones of inhibition were observed in S. aureus and E. coli cultures on NCH treatment, confirming its antibacterial properties. Our studies show that the pH-responsive NCH can be potentially used for adjuvant skin cancer treatment and wound healing.",Journal of materials chemistry.

34286812,Fabrication of an injectable hydrogel with inherent photothermal effects from tannic acid for synergistic photothermal-chemotherapy.,"Developing injectable hydrogels with near-infrared (NIR)-responsive photothermal effects has increasingly become a promising strategy for local cancer treatment via combinational photothermal-chemotherapy. Herein, a biocompatible hydrogel with a remarkable shear-thinning and recovery capability for injection application was fabricated from 4-arm-PEG-SH and tannic acid through chemical crosslinking and multiple physical interactions. Benefiting from the formation of dynamic TA/Fe3+ complexes within gel networks, the obtained hydrogel exhibited an intrinsic NIR absorption property for photothermal ablation of tumor cells, and enhanced cellular uptake of chemotherapeutic drugs. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that the injectable hydrogel exhibited an excellent biocompatibility and a synergistic therapeutic effect on tumor growth via combinational photothermal-chemotherapy. Therefore, this work provides a promising attempt to develop an injectable and NIR-responsive hydrogel from TA/Fe3+ complexes, which could work as a localized drug delivery platform for synergistic photothermal-chemotherapy.",Journal of materials chemistry.

32744280,Biocompatible polypeptide-based interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels with enhanced mechanical properties.,"Hydrogels are widely used for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, or wound healing owing to their mimetic properties in relation to biological tissues. The generation of peptide-based hydrogels is a topic of interest due to their potential to increase biocompatibility. However, their usages can be limited when compared to other synthetic hydrogels because of their inferior mechanical properties. Herein, we present the synthesis of novel synthetic polypeptide-based interpenetrating network (IPN) hydrogels with enhanced mechanical properties. The polypeptide single network is obtained from alkyne functional polypeptides crosslinked with di, tri and tetra azide functional PEG by copper-catalysed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC). Interpenetrating networks were subsequently obtained by loading of the polypeptide single network with PEG-dithiol and orthogonally UV-crosslinking with varying molar ratios of pentaerythritol tetraacrylate. The characteristics, including the mechanical strength (i.e. compressive strength (UCS), fracture strain (epsilon(break)), and Young's modulus (E)) and cell compatibility (i.e. metabolic activity and Live/Dead of human Mesenchymal Stem Cells), of each synthetic polypeptide-based IPN hydrogel were studied and evaluated in order to demonstrate their potential as mechanically robust hydrogels for use as artificial tissues. Moreover, (1)H NMR diffusometry was carried out to examine the water mobility (D(H(2)O)) within the polypeptide-based hydrogels and IPNs. It was found that both the mechanical and morphological properties could be tailored concurrently with the hydrophilicity, rate of water diffusion and 'swellability'. Finally it was shown that the polypeptide-based IPN hydrogels exhibited good biocompatibility, highlighting their potential as soft tissue scaffolds.",Journal of materials chemistry.

32400836,Coaxial mussel-inspired biofibers: making of a robust and efficacious depot for cancer drug delivery.,"Biopolymer-based hydrogels have emerged as promising platforms for drug delivery systems (DDSs) due to their inherent biocompatibility, tunable physical properties and controllable degradability. Yet, drug release in majority of these systems is solely contingent on diffusion of drug molecules through the hydrogel, which often leads to burst release of drugs from these systems. Herein, inspired by the chemistry of mussel adhesive proteins, a new generation of coaxial hydrogel fibers was developed that could simultaneously exert both affinity and diffusion control over the release of chemotherapeutic drugs. Specifically, dopamine-modified alginate hydrogel along with chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin or gemcitabine) was used as the main core component to confer affinity-controlled release, while a methacrylated-alginate hydrogel was used as the shell composition to provide the controlled diffusion barrier. It was shown that our coaxial mussel-inspired biofibers yielded biocompatible hydrogel fibers (as indicated by comprehensive in vitro and in vivo experiments) with favourable properties including controlled swelling, and enhanced mechanical properties, when compared against single fibers made from unmodified alginate. Notably, it was observed that these coaxial fibers were capable of releasing the two drugs in a slower manner, when compared to single fibers made from pure alginate, which was partly attributed to stronger interactions of drugs with dopamine-modified alginate (the core element of coaxial fibers) as observed from zeta-potential measurements. It was further shown that these drug-loaded coaxial fibers had optimal anticancer activity both in vitro and in vivo using various pancreatic cancer cell lines. Most remarkably, drug loaded coaxial fibers, particularly doxorubicin-containing fibers, had higher anticancer effect in vivo compared to systemic injection of equivalent dosage of the drugs. Altogether, these biocompatible and robust hydrogel fibers may be further used as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies for controlled delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs locally to the tumor sites.",Journal of materials chemistry.

31950969,Beyond Fmoc: a review of aromatic peptide capping groups.,"Self-assembling short peptides have attracted widespread interest due to their tuneable, biocompatible nature and have potential applications in energy materials, tissue engineering, sensing and drug delivery. The hierarchical self-assembly of these peptides is highly dependent on the selection of not only amino acid sequence, but also the capping group which is often employed at the N-terminus of the peptide to drive self-assembly. Although the Fmoc (9H-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) group is commonly used due to its utility in solid phase peptide synthesis, many other aromatic capping groups have been reported which yield functional, responsive materials. This review explores recent developments in the utilisation of functional, aromatic capping groups beyond the Fmoc group for the creation of redox-responsive, fluorescent and drug delivering hydrogel scaffolds.",Journal of materials chemistry.

32254689,Poly(ester amide)-based hybrid hydrogels for efficient transdermal insulin delivery.,"Transdermal drug delivery is an attractive, non-invasive treatment. It can avoid first-pass hepatic metabolism and provides the possibility of self-administration. Hydrogels are promising biomaterials due to their important qualities such as biocompatibility and biodegradability. Recently, there has been tremendous growth in the area of hydrogels for transdermal drug delivery. In this work, a new kind of arginine-based poly(ester amide) (Arg-PEA) and polyethylene glycol diacrylamide (PEG-DA) hybrid hydrogel was developed for transdermal drug delivery. The hydrogels not only possess excellent swelling capacity, but also have good mechanical properties, which were then evaluated as drug delivery agents using insulin as a model system. Cytotoxicity testing and in vivo skin irritation tests demonstrated that the hydrogels were biocompatible. Finally, the results indicated that the prepared hydrogels could not only perform transdermal drug delivery, but also might regulate blood glucose levels in a mouse model with streptozotocin-induced diabetes.",Journal of materials chemistry.

32255072,Pulsatile release from a flat self-oscillating chitosan macrogel.,"Coupling oscillatory chemical reactions to smart materials which can respond to external stimuli is considered an answer to the long-standing issue of pulsatile drug delivery. Although a number of coupled architectures exist, there are no systems reporting pH-controlled pulsed drug release based on chemical oscillators. In this paper, we report for the first time a proof-of-concept self-oscillatory chitosan macrogel, employing the palladium-catalysed oxidative carbonylation reaction as the driving force of its oscillations. The reported hydrogel is composed of highly biocompatible components and a novel imine-functionalised chitosan-palladium catalyst with zero leaching rates. This macrogel was shown to rhythmically release not only the products of the reaction, but also fluorescein, which is used as an FDA-approved model drug. The step-wise release pattern corresponded to the step-wise dynamics of pH decrease in methanol:water, while in pure methanol, the changes in pH had an oscillatory mode, accompanied by mirrored oscillations in fluorescein concentration. This proof-of-concept system significantly expands the horizons of pulsatile delivery materials for future research.",Journal of materials chemistry.

32254301,pH-Sensitive nanogels based on the electrostatic self-assembly of radionuclide (131)I labeled albumin and carboxymethyl cellulose for synergistic combined chemo-radioisotope therapy of cancer.,"Development of biocompatible and biodegradable nanocarriers with multiple functionalities has attracted great interest in recent years. In this study, a hybrid hydrogel nanoparticle (nanogel) platform based on the self-assembly of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) is presented for the first time. It was facile to realize the efficient co-delivery of radionuclide (131)I and chemotherapeutic drugs such as camptothecin (CPT) to achieve the combined chemo-radioisotope therapy of cancer. Notably, a nanogel was prepared by a simple and green electrostatic interaction approach, instead of chemical reaction, showing typical spherical shape with average size about 120 nm, high drug loading capacity, robust stability and low hemolysis. Interestingly, such nanogels exhibited pH-dependent drug release profile, leading to significant reduction of damage to normal tissues. Furthermore, the as-prepared nanogels could effectively promote intracellular uptake, prolong blood circulation time and enhance accumulation in the tumor tissues. As a result, an excellent therapeutic effect was achieved both in vitro and in vivo through combined chemo-radioisotope therapy. Collectively, this study presents the preparation of a novel green nanocarrier by a reliable and simple approach, and offers an effective strategy for the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.",Journal of materials chemistry.

32264457,Sustained subconjunctival delivery of cyclosporine A using thermogelling polymers for glaucoma filtration surgery.,"Filtration surgery is currently being acknowledged as the most effective therapeutic modality for glaucoma; however, excessive scarring of a filtering bleb often leads to surgical failure. Subconjunctival administration of drug delivery systems provides a localized and sustained delivery of antifibrotic drugs to inhibit post-operative scarring. In this study, a long-acting delivery system of Cyclosporine A (CsA) was developed using thermogelling poly-(dl-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly-(dl-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) triblock copolymers as the carrier. The drug could be easily entrapped into the polymer aqueous solution by simply mixing them at room temperature, and the prepared formulation was spontaneously transformed into an in situ thermogel loaded with drugs at body temperature. The formulation exhibited a sustained in vitro release of CsA from the thermogel over 2 months. The in vivo efficacy of subconjunctival administration of the CsA-loaded hydrogel system in inhibiting filtering bleb scarring was evaluated on a rabbit model of filtration surgery. No ocular tissue abnormalities and damage were observed. Compared with a local administration of the popular Mitomycin C solution at the surgery site, the CsA-loaded thermogel system remarkably inhibited scar formation, maintained stable low intraocular pressure and promoted filtering bleb survival for more than 10 weeks. This feature was attributed to both the anti-adhesion nature of the thermogel matrix and the antifibrotic effect of the sustainedly released CsA. These results suggest that the injectable PLGA-PEG-PLGA thermogel is a biocompatible carrier for sustained subconjunctival drug delivery, and the CsA-loaded hydrogel formulation has great potential for ocular antifibrotic therapy after glaucoma filtration surgery and others.",Journal of materials chemistry.

28652917,"Photocrosslinkable, biodegradable hydrogels with controlled cell adhesivity for prolonged siRNA delivery to hMSCs to enhance their osteogenic differentiation.","Photocrosslinked, biodegradable hydrogels have been extensively investigated for biomedical applications, including drug delivery and tissue engineering. Here, dextran (DEX) was chemically modified with mono(2-acryloyloxyethyl) succinate (MAES) via an esterification reaction, resulting in macromers that could be photocrosslinked to form hydrolytically degradable hydrogels. Hydrogel swelling ratio and degradation rate were controlled by varying the degree of MAES modification. Thiolated cell adhesion peptides (GRGDSPC) were conjugated to acrylated dextran via thiol-acrylate reaction to regulate the interactions of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) with the photocrosslinkable hydrogels. The hydrogels permitted sustained release of short interfering RNA (siRNA) over 7 weeks and were cytocompatible with hMSCs. Sustained presentation of siRNA from these photocrosslinked DEX hydrogels enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of encapsulated hMSCs. These DEX hydrogels with tunable siRNA delivery and cell adhesive properties may provide an excellent platform for bioactive molecule delivery and tissue regeneration applications.",Journal of materials chemistry.

32264143,An injectable ionic hydrogel inducing high temperature hyperthermia for microwave tumor ablation.,"Microwave tumor ablation is of clinical significance and has been considered as a promising cancer minimally invasive therapy. One of the challenges in this field is the optimization of the susceptible agent. Herein, a novel chitosan-based ionic hydrogel which can induce rather high temperature hyperthermia as a susceptible agent for microwave ablation is reported. Owning to the high porosity of the hydrogel, a strong ion confinement effect can be realized, therefore, strong polarization under microwave exposure is ensured for rapid heat generation. In addition, the as-synthesized hydrogel has negligible bio-toxicity and excellent spatial stability in vivo which can guarantee a reproducible therapeutic effect for repeated treatment. In vivo anti-tumor investigation has demonstrated that excellent therapeutic efficiency can be achieved after repeated microwave thermal therapy with a rather low power density (2.0 W, 2.45 GHz). Further, computer simulation was conducted to elucidate the microwave heating mechanism. Our investigation provides a biocompatible and stable agent for microwave tumor ablation and demonstrates its great significance for potential clinical application.",Journal of materials chemistry.

32263991,Cross-linked antifouling polysaccharide hydrogel coating as extracellular matrix mimics for wound healing.,"Conventional wound dressings cannot provide an appropriate environment for tissue repair and regeneration and easily adhere to wounds causing damage to the new epithelial tissues, which leads to bleeding. Herein, a new antifouling hydrogel based on a natural polysaccharide was developed for wound healing. The biocompatible hydrogel with an ideal three-dimensional network composited of chitosan and dextran was synthesized by the Michael addition reaction. The hydrogel showed good swelling and cytocompatibility against NIH3T3. Moreover, the antifouling hydrogel was obtained by adjusting the proportion of positive and negative charges of chitosan and dextran. Antifouling hydrogels overcoming the deficiency of traditional wound dressings could inhibit bacterial and cellular adhesion effectively and also be applied as a carrier for protein delivery. After the wound was treated by bFGF-loaded hydrogels, significantly greater wound contraction was observed, which demonstrated their superior healing activity to promote fibroblast migration, granulation tissue formation and angiogenesis by up-regulation of VEGF and PCNA expression. These results showed that the obtained antifouling hydrogel may be a promising therapeutic strategy for managing diabetic ulcers.",Journal of materials chemistry.

32263151,Dual cellular stimuli-responsive hydrogel nanocapsules for delivery of anticancer drugs.,"In this work, we report dual cellular environmental stimuli-responsive hydrogel nanocapsules (HA-NCs) for delivery of an anticancer drug (doxorubicin, DOX). This nanocapsule drug delivery system was specially designed to be triggered by stimuli in intra-cellular environments, specifically high glutathione (GSH) concentration and low pH. Biocompatible hyaluronan was used as the basic nanocapsule shell building material. Chemical modifications were conducted in order to functionalize it; specifically, GSH cleavable crosslinking sites and pH responsive expansion sites were introduced. After passive delivery to tumor sites via an enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect and cellular uptake, the nanocapsule shells underwent a swelling/disassembly process due to high GSH concentration (e.g., 10 mM), which induced cleavage of disulfide (S-S) bonds, and low pH (e.g., pH 5), which caused water influx associated with deprotection of the acetal groups. This process enabled rupture of the hydrogel nanocapsules and therefore resulted in release of the encapsulated payloads. This hydrogel nanocapsule system exhibited a great ability to release the vast majority of the encapsulated DOX in tumor cells, as proven by the remarkably (4.7-fold) accelerated drug release rate within tumor cells (pH 5.0, GSH 10 mM), in sharp contrast to the drug release rate under physiological conditions (pH 7.4, GSH 0). In vitro bio-evaluation showed the good biocompatibility of the nanocapsule carriers and their efficient cancer cell growth inhibition activity after drug encapsulation. In vivo studies confirmed that the DOX containing nanocapsules (DOX/HA-NCs) had comparable antitumor efficiency and greatly reduced side effects as compared with free DOX (DOX.HCl).",Journal of materials chemistry.

The HBC hydrogel was shown to be cytocompatible, while the dual drug-loaded HBC hydrogel could suppress the proliferation of keloid fibroblasts (KFs). The keloid biopsies treated with the dual drug-loaded hydrogel could be inhibited through the efficient suppression of VEGF expression within 7 days.

With the incorporation of CBMA, these hydrogels demonstrated better mechanical properties, a slower degradation rate, and a controlled drug release rate compared with the GelMA alone group. GelMA/CBMA hydrogels also showed good cell viability. As in the in vivo test, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-loaded GelMA/CBMA hydrogels displayed certain degrees of angiogenesis. These results indicate that GelMA/CBMA hydrogels are biocompatible, and the properties of GelMA/CBMA hydrogels can be easily tuned with the ratio of CBMA.

Attenuated Total Reflectance Infrared Spectra and (1)H NMR were used to characterize the structure of the hydrogel. The hydrogel has a high elasticity (a tensile modulus of 36.5 +/- 0.5 kPa and a storage modulus of 52.9 +/- 1.2 kPa) at a high water content (91.2 +/- 0.4%). Swelling, mechanical and rheological properties of the hydrogel can be tuned by the content of the crosslinker, light and reductant. The hydrogel has low cytotoxicity and it can be used for drug delivery. Ultraviolet irradiation helped to load drugs and the reductant accelerated the drug release. With its high mechanical properties and light- and reductant-responsiveness, the hydrogel is hopefully to be used as a drug carrier.",Journal of materials chemistry.

The biodegradable, biocompatible hybrid hydrogel platform was fabricated from gelatin methacrylamide (Gel-MA) and arginine based unsaturated non-peptide polycations (Arg-UPEA) through UV photo-crosslinking, combining the favorable properties of gelatin and arginine. The hydrogels were systematically characterized based on their mechanical properties, swelling mechanics, interior morphology, and biodegradation capability. The in vitro biocompatibility study showed that the hybrid hydrogels show better performance than GelMA hydrogels, in terms of cell attachment and proliferation. Therapeutic proteins were loaded into the hydrogels and their release behavior was investigated. The loading and release profiles indicated that the new cationic gelatin hydrogels could significantly improve the protein loading capabilities, and release the proteins in vitro in a sustained manner. The structure-function study indicated that the material composition has a large effect on the properties of the hydrogels.",Journal of materials chemistry.
