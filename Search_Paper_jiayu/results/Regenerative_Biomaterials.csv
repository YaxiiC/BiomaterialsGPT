38628545,Enhanced burn wound healing by controlled-release 3D ADMSC-derived exosome-loaded hyaluronan hydrogel.,"Adipose mesenchymal stem cell (ADMSC)-derived exosomes (ADMSC-Exos) have shown great potential in regenerative medicine and been evidenced benefiting wound repair such as burns. However, the low yield, easy loss after direct coating, and no suitable loading system to improve their availability and efficacy hinder their clinical application for wound healing. And few studies focused on the comparison of biological functions between exosomes derived from different culture techniques, especially in exosome-releasing hydrogel system. Therefore, we designed a high-performance exosome controllable releasing hydrogel system for burn wound healing, namely loading 3D-printed microfiber culture-derived exosomes in a highly biocompatible hyaluronic acid (HA). In this project, we compared the biological functions in vitro and in a burn model among exosomes derived from the conventional two-dimensional (2D) plate culture (2D-Exos), microcarrier culture (2.5D-Exos), and 3D-printed microfiber culture (3D-Exos). Results showed that compared with 2D-Exos and 2.5D-Exos, 3D-Exos promoted HACATs and HUVECs cell proliferation and migration more significantly. Additionally, 3D-Exos had stronger angiogenesis-promoting effects in tube formation of (HUVECs) cells. Moreover, we found HA-loaded 3D-Exos showed better burn wound healing promotion compared to 2D-Exos and 2.5D-Exos, including accelerated burn wound healing rate and better collagen remodeling. The study findings reveal that the HA-loaded, controllable-release 3D-Exos repair system distinctly augments therapeutic efficacy in terms of wound healing, while concurrently introducing a facile application approach. This system markedly bolsters the exosomal loading efficiency, provides a robust protective milieu, and potentiates the inherent biological functionalities of the exosomes. Our findings provide a rationale for more efficient utilization of high-quality and high-yield 3D exosomes in the future, and a novel strategy for healing severe burns.",Regenerative biomaterials,2024,Journal Article,10.1093/rb/rbae035,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38628545/,
26816625,Multi-responsive hydrogels for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications.,"Multi-responsive hydrogels, or 'intelligent' hydrogels that respond to more than one environmental stimulus, have demonstrated great utility as a regenerative biomaterial in recent years. They are structured biocompatible materials that provide specific and distinct responses to varied physiological or externally applied stimuli. As evidenced by a burgeoning number of investigators, multi-responsive hydrogels are endowed with tunable, controllable and even biomimetic behavior well-suited for drug delivery and tissue engineering or regenerative growth applications. This article encompasses recent developments and challenges regarding supramolecular, layer-by-layer assembled and covalently cross-linked multi-responsive hydrogel networks and their application to drug delivery and tissue engineering.",Regenerative biomaterials,2014 Nov,Journal Article; Review,10.1093/rb/rbu006,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26816625/,
