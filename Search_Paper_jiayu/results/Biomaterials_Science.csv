39292506,Alginate/GelMA microparticles via oil-free interface shearing for untethered magnetic microbots.,"Microrobots hold broad application prospects in the field of precision medicine, such as intravenous drug injection, tumor resection, opening blood vessels and imaging during abdominal surgery. However, the rapid and controllable preparation of biocompatible hydrogel microparticles still poses challenges. This study proposes the one-step direct acquisition of biocompatible sodium alginate and gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel microparticles using an oil-free aqueous solution, ensuring production with a controllable generation frequency. An adaptive interface shearing platform is established to fabricate alginate/GelMA microparticles using a mixture of the hydrogel, photoinitiator, and Fe(3)O(4) nanoparticles (NPs). By adjusting the static magnetic field intensity (B(s)), vibration frequency, and flow rate (Q) of the dispersed phase, the size and morphology of the hydrogel microparticles can be controlled. These hydrogel microparticle robots exhibit magnetic responsiveness, demonstrating precise rotating and rolling movements under the influence of an externally rotating magnetic field (RMF). Moreover, hydrogel microparticle robots with a specific critical frequency (C(f)) can be customized by adjusting the B(s) and the concentration of Fe(3)O(4) NPs. The directional in situ untethered motion of the hydrogel microparticle robots can be successfully realized and accurately controlled in the climbing over obstacles and in vitro experiments of animals, respectively. This versatile and fully biodegradable microrobot has the potential to precisely control movement to bone tissue and the natural cavity of the human body, as well as drug delivery.",Biomaterials science,2024 Oct 22,Journal Article,10.1039/d4bm00875h,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39292506/,
36748206,A simple method for fabricating drugs containing a cis-o-diol structure into guanosine-based supramolecular hydrogels for drug delivery.,"Supramolecular hydrogels are attractive biomaterials for local drug delivery owing to their excellent self-healing, injectable, biodegradable, and biocompatible properties. However, traditional drug-loading approaches based on non-covalent encapsulation and covalent bonding have shown problems such as rapid or difficult drug release, complex reaction processes, low reaction efficiency, and decreased drug activity. Therefore, there is a need to find a simple and efficient method to load drugs into hydrogels, which possess stable drug release ability without impairing drug efficacy. In this study, we introduce dynamic borate ester bonds via a simple one-pot method to load cis-o-diol-containing drugs into guanosine (G)-based supramolecular hydrogels. The experimental results confirm that the dynamic covalent borate ester bonds are formed based on the cis-o-diol groups of the drug and the G in these hydrogels. Meanwhile, the as-prepared G-based hydrogels not only possess self-healing properties and injectability but also have satisfactory biodegradability and biocompatibility. Additionally, the drug can be released from the G-based hydrogel according to the pH-responsive cleavage of the borate ester bonds without affecting drug activity. Overall, these results indicate that the simple one-pot method of utilizing the dynamic borate bond can provide a valuable reference for the design of hydrogel dosage forms.",Biomaterials science,2023 May 2,Journal Article,10.1039/d3bm00057e,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36748206/,
35786706,Development of gelatin methacrylate (GelMa) hydrogels for versatile intracavitary applications.,"Applicability of hydrogels as drug delivery systems is on the rise due to their highly tunable degree of polymeric crosslinking to attain varying rates of payload release. Sustaining the release of therapeutic payloads at certain physiological sites has been the need of the hour to treat disorders such as peritoneal or pleural malignancies. These disorders can be targeted via intracavitary administration of hydrogels, providing localized therapy. In this study, a gelatin methacrylate (GelMa) hydrogel with tunable physicochemical traits is developed and characterized. A hydrogel-based depot system was curated using GelMa as backbone, a photo-initiator (lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate) and a chemical crosslinker (N,N-methylenebisacrylamide). Hydrogels were optimized using a 2(3) factorial design, by testing for their gelling time, injectability, viscosity change, elasticity, bio-adhesion, swelling-index, in vitro degradation, in vitro release, and biocompatibility. Gelling time for hydrogel formulations was found to be <60 seconds with gelling being achieved in as fast as 24 seconds. Bio-adhesion studies revealed that formulations with higher concentrations of both crosslinkers had more adhesion to guinea pig lung tissues. Hydrogels with higher swelling showcased a more sustained release. Biocompatibility studies for hydrogel formulations was done by evaluating formulation performance in MTT, live/dead, and apoptosis assays performed using non-malignant Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). The optimized hydrogel formulations were biocompatible, yielding >90% cellular viability over 72 hours. This delivery system prototype may be used to deliver potent chemotherapeutics locally, reducing off target effects and improving therapeutic benefits.",Biomaterials science,2022 Aug 9,Journal Article,10.1039/d2bm00022a,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35786706/,
34582523,Injectable shear-thinning polylysine hydrogels for localized immunotherapy of gastric cancer through repolarization of tumor-associated macrophages.,"Immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most promising treatments for cancer in recent years. However, it works only for a small proportion of patients, which can in part be attributed to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are the critical components of tumors and play an important role in the development of the immunosuppressive TME. The transition of TAMs from the pro-tumor (M2) phenotype to anti-tumor (M1) phenotype is crucial for the immunotherapy of gastric cancer. Herein, we developed a shear-thinning, injectable hydrogel co-loaded with polyphyllin II (PP2) and resiquimod (R848) (PR-Gel) for potentiating localized immunotherapy of gastric cancer through the repolarization of TAMs. In this work, we evaluate the effects of PR-Gel on TAM repolarization and explored its therapeutic effect for localized immunotherapy. The hydrogels were synthesized through the Schiff base reactions between aldehyde-functionalized polyethylene glycol and the amino group of polylysine. A M2-to-M1 repolarization of TAMs and increased production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 were observed after treatment with PR-Gel in vitro. The anti-tumor efficacy of PR-Gel in a subcutaneous xenograft model of gastric cancer showed that the hydrogels possess good tumor growth suppression properties after a single injection. Furthermore, an increased iNOS/CD206 ratio in TAMs and enhanced CD8+ T cell infiltration were also observed within the TME after the treatment with PR-Gel. Hence, the biocompatible, shear-thinning, injectable hydrogels are a promising noninvasive drug-delivery platform for the regulation of the immunosuppressive TME and have great potential in localized immunotherapy against gastric cancer.",Biomaterials science,2021 Sep 28,Journal Article,10.1039/d1bm01053k,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34582523/,
33438696,Injectable nanofibrillar hydrogels based on charge-complementary peptide co-assemblies.,"Injectable hydrogels are attractive for therapeutic delivery because they can be locally administered through minimally-invasive routes. Charge-complementary peptide nanofibers provide hydrogels that are suitable for encapsulation of biotherapeutics, such as cells and proteins, because they assemble under physiological temperature, pH, and ionic strength. However, relationships between the sequences of charge-complementary peptides and the physical properties of the hydrogels that they form are not well understood. Here we show that hydrogel viscoelasticity, pore size, and pore structure depend on the pairing of charge-complementary ""CATCH(+/-)"" peptides. Oscillatory rheology demonstrated that co-assemblies of CATCH(4+/4-), CATCH(4+/6-), CATCH(6+/4-), and CATCH(6+/6-) formed viscoelastic gels that can recover after high-shear and high-strain disruption, although the extent of recovery depends on the peptide pairing. Cryogenic scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that hydrogel pore size and pore wall also depend on peptide pairing, and that these properties change to different extents after injection. In contrast, no obvious correlation was observed between nanofiber charge state, measured with zeta-potential, and hydrogel physical properties. CATCH(4+/6-) hydrogels injected into the subcutaneous space elicited weak, transient inflammation whereas CATCH(6+/4-) hydrogels induced stronger inflammation. No antibodies were raised against the CATCH(4+) or CATCH(6-) peptides following multiple challenges in vehicle or when co-administered with an adjuvant. These results demonstrate that CATCH(+/-) peptides form biocompatible injectable hydrogels with viscoelastic properties that can be tuned by varying peptide sequence, establishing their potential as carriers for localized delivery of therapeutic cargoes.",Biomaterials science,2021 Apr 7,Journal Article,10.1039/d0bm01372b,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33438696/,
32352105,Long-term delivery of alendronate through an injectable tetra-PEG hydrogel to promote osteoporosis therapy.,"Pharmacotherapy for hypercalcemia, which is mainly caused by osteoporosis, is an effective method to regulate the in vivo calcium equilibrium. From this perspective, the development of a minimally invasive gelling system for the prolonged local delivery of bisphosphonates has practical significance in the clinical therapy of bone osteoporosis. Here, a biocompatible and injectable hydrogel based on a uniform tetra-PEG network carrying a PEG-modified alendronate (ALN) prodrug for the localized elution and long-term sustained release of anti-osteoporotic small molecule drugs is reported. The obtained ALN-based tetra-PEG hydrogels exhibit rapid gel formation and excellent injectability, thereby allowing for the easy injection and consequent adaptation of hydrogels into the bone defects with irregular shapes, which promotes the ALN-based tetra-PEG hydrogels with depot formulation capacity for governing the on-demand release of ALN drugs and local reinforcement of bone osteoporosis at the implantation sites of animals. The findings imply that these injectable hydrogels mediate the optimized release of therapeutic cargoes and effectively promote in situ bone regeneration via minimally invasive procedures, which is effective for clinical osteoporosis therapy.",Biomaterials science,2020 Jun 7,Journal Article,10.1039/d0bm00376j,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32352105/,
31724665,Responsive agarose hydrogel incorporated with natural humic acid and MnO(2) nanoparticles for effective relief of tumor hypoxia and enhanced photo-induced tumor therapy.,"In spite of widespread applications of nano-photosensitizers, poor tumor penetration and severe hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment (TME) always result in an undesirable therapeutic outcome of photodynamic therapy (PDT). Herein, a biocompatible agarose-based hydrogel incorporated with sodium humate (SH), manganese oxide (MnO(2)) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) was synthesized as agarose@SH/MnO(2)/Ce6 through a ""co-trapped"" strategy during a sol-gel process and employed for combined photothermal therapy (PTT) and enhanced PDT. NIR-induced local hyperthermia is responsible for not only activating Ce6 release, but also triggering the catalytic decomposition of H(2)O(2) mediated by MnO(2) to relieve hypoxia. Such a hybrid hydrogel can realize deep tissue penetration through intratumoral injection, and exhibit remarkable tumor-site retention. Moreover, programmed laser irradiation led to an extremely high tumor growth inhibition rate of 93.8% in virtue of enhanced PTT/PDT. In addition, ultralow systemic toxicity caused by the hybrid hydrogel was further demonstrated in vivo. This reliable and eco-friendly hydrogel paves the way for the development of smart gel-based biomaterials, which respond to both exogenous and endogenous stimuli, towards the management of cancer and other major diseases.",Biomaterials science,2020 Jan 1,Journal Article,10.1039/c9bm01472a,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31724665/,
30855616,Direct ink writing with high-strength and swelling-resistant biocompatible physically crosslinked hydrogels.,"The three-dimensional (3D) printing of hydrogels has great potential for biomedicine applications. However, it is very rare to find suitable printable materials with high strength and swelling resistance that can offer high performance. To address this challenge, this paper demonstrates the fabrication of tailored hydrogel structures by using the direct ink writing (DIW) of hybrid hydrogel inks (polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and kappa-carrageenan) with outstanding rheology. The freezing and thawing processes following DIW induce the formation of physically crosslinked networks due to the crystallinity of PVA, and thus enhance the mechanical properties and swelling resistance of the printed architectures. The resultant hydrogels exhibit excellent cytocompatibility, and most importantly, cells not only attach well to the surface of the hydrogels, but also stretch into the spaces in the grid architectures, providing appropriate microenvironments for cell culture. The physically crosslinked hydrogels, with high strength, outstanding swelling resistance, biocompatibility, and good compatibility with the DIW technique, offer many opportunities in fields such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, bone regeneration and implant medicine.",Biomaterials science,2019 Apr 23,Journal Article,10.1039/c9bm00081j,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30855616/,
28805830,In vitro and in vivo analysis of visible light crosslinkable gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels.,"Photocrosslinkable materials have been frequently used for constructing soft and biomimetic hydrogels for tissue engineering. Although ultraviolet (UV) light is commonly used for photocrosslinking such materials, its use has been associated with several biosafety concerns such as DNA damage, accelerated aging of tissues, and cancer. Here we report an injectable visible light crosslinked gelatin-based hydrogel for myocardium regeneration. Mechanical characterization revealed that the compressive moduli of the engineered hydrogels could be tuned in the range of 5-56 kPa by changing the concentrations of the initiator, co-initiator and co-monomer in the precursor formulation. In addition, the average pore sizes (26-103 mum) and swelling ratios (7-13%) were also shown to be tunable by varying the hydrogel formulation. In vitro studies showed that visible light crosslinked GelMA hydrogels supported the growth and function of primary cardiomyocytes (CMs). In addition, the engineered materials were shown to be biocompatible in vivo, and could be successfully delivered to the heart after myocardial infarction in an animal model to promote tissue healing. The developed visible light crosslinked hydrogel could be used for the repair of various soft tissues such as the myocardium and for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases with enhanced therapeutic functionality.",Biomaterials science,2017 Sep 26,Journal Article,10.1039/c7bm00110j,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28805830/,
28174779,Improving gelation efficiency and cytocompatibility of visible light polymerized thiol-norbornene hydrogels via addition of soluble tyrosine.,"Hydrogels immobilized with biomimetic peptides have been used widely for tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. Photopolymerization has been among the most commonly used techniques to fabricate peptide-immobilized hydrogels as it offers rapid and robust peptide immobilization within a crosslinked hydrogel network. Both chain-growth and step-growth photopolymerizations can be used to immobilize peptides within covalently crosslinked hydrogels. A previously developed visible light mediated step-growth thiol-norbornene gelation scheme has demonstrated efficient crosslinking of hydrogels composed of an inert poly(ethylene glycol)-norbornene (PEGNB) macromer and a small molecular weight bis-thiol linker, such as dithiothreitol (DTT). Compared with conventional visible light mediated chain-polymerizations where multiple initiator components are required, step-growth photopolymerized thiol-norbornene hydrogels are more cytocompatible for the in situ encapsulation of radical sensitive cells (e.g., pancreatic beta-cells). This contribution explored visible light based crosslinking of various bis-cysteine containing peptides with macromer 8-arm PEGNB to form biomimetic hydrogels suitable for in situ cell encapsulation. It was found that the addition of soluble tyrosine during polymerization not only significantly accelerated gelation, but also improved the crosslinking efficiency of PEG-peptide hydrogels as evidenced by a decreased gel point and enhanced gel modulus. In addition, soluble tyrosine drastically enhanced the cytocompatibility of the resulting PEG-peptide hydrogels, as demonstrated by in situ encapsulation and culture of pancreatic MIN6 beta-cells. This visible light based thiol-norbornene crosslinking mechanism provides an attractive gelation method for preparing cytocompatible PEG-peptide hydrogels for tissue engineering applications.",Biomaterials science,2017 Feb 28,Journal Article,10.1039/c6bm00778c,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28174779/,
25717375,Design of thiol-ene photoclick hydrogels using facile techniques for cell culture applicationsdaggerElectronic supplementary information (ESI) available. See DOI: 10.1039/c4bm00187gClick here for additional data file.,"Thiol-ene 'click' chemistries have been widely used in biomaterials applications, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and controlled cell culture, owing to their rapid, cytocompatible, and often orthogonal reactivity. In particular, hydrogel-based biomaterials formed by photoinitiated thiol-ene reactions afford spatiotemporal control over the biochemical and biomechanical properties of the network for creating synthetic materials that mimic the extracellular matrix or enable controlled drug release. However, the use of charged peptides functionalized with cysteines, which can form disulfides prior to reaction, and vinyl monomers that require multistep syntheses and contain ester bonds, may lead to undesired inhomogeneity or degradation under cell culture conditions. Here, we designed a thiol-ene hydrogel formed by the reaction of allyloxycarbonyl-functionalized peptides and thiol-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol). Hydrogels were polymerized by free radical initiation under cytocompatible doses of long wavelength ultraviolet light in the presence of water-soluble photoinitiators (lithium acylphosphinate, LAP, and 2-hydroxy-1-[4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)phenyl]-2-methyl-1-propanone, Irgacure 2959). Mechanical properties of these hydrogels were controlled by varying the monomer concentration to mimic a range of soft tissue environments, and hydrogel stability in cell culture medium was observed over weeks. Patterns of biochemical cues were created within the hydrogels post-formation and confirmed through the incorporation of fluorescently-labeled peptides and Ellman's assay to detect free thiols. Human mesenchymal stem cells remained viable after encapsulation and subsequent photopatterning, demonstrating the utility of the monomers and hydrogels for three-dimensional cell culture. This facile approach enables the formation and characterization of hydrogels with well-defined, spatially-specific properties and expands the suite of monomers available for three-dimensional cell culture and other biological applications.",Biomaterials science,2014 Nov 30,Journal Article,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25717375/,
