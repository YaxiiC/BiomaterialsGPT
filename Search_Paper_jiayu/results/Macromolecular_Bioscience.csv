38265144,Hydrogels in Gene Delivery Techniques for Regenerative Medicine and Tissue Engineering.,"Hydrogels are 3D networks swollen with water. They are biocompatible, strong, and moldable and are emerging as a promising biomedical material for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering to deliver therapeutic genes. The excellent natural extracellular matrix simulation properties of hydrogels enable them to be co-cultured with cells or enhance the expression of viral or non-viral vectors. Its biocompatibility, high strength, and degradation performance also make the action process of carriers in tissues more ideal, making it an ideal biomedical material. It has been shown that hydrogel-based gene delivery technologies have the potential to play therapy-relevant roles in organs such as bone, cartilage, nerve, skin, reproductive organs, and liver in animal experiments and preclinical trials. This paper reviews recent articles on hydrogels in gene delivery and explains the manufacture, applications, developmental timeline, limitations, and future directions of hydrogel-based gene delivery techniques.",Macromolecular bioscience,2024 Jun,Journal Article; Review,10.1002/mabi.202300577,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38265144/,
37534769,A Novel Methacryloyl Chitosan Hydrogel Microneedles Patch with Sustainable Drug Release Property for Effective Treatment of Psoriasis.,"Psoriasis is a chronic and recurrent skin disease that often requires long-term treatment, and topical transdermal drug delivery can reduce systemic side effects. However, it is still a challenge in efficient transdermal drug delivery for psoriasis treatment due to low penetration efficiency of most drugs and the abnormal skin conditions of psoriasis patients. Here, a safe and effective methacryloyl chitosan hydrogel microneedles (CSMA hMNs) patch is developed and served as a sustained drug release platform for the treatment of psoriasis. By systematically optimizing the CSMA preparation, CSMA hMNs with excellent morphological characteristics and strong mechanical properties (0.7 N needle(-1) ) are prepared with a concentration of only 3% (w/v) CSMA. As a proof-of-concept, methotrexate (MTX) and nicotinamide (NIC) are loaded into CSMA hMNs patch, which can produce a sustained drug release of 80% within 24 h in vitro. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the CSMA hMNs patch can effectively inhibit the skin thickening and spleen enlargement of psoriatic mice and has a good biosafety profile at sufficient therapeutic doses. This study provides a new idea for the preparation of hMN systems using modified CS or other biocompatible materials and offers an effective therapeutic option for psoriasis treatment.",Macromolecular bioscience,2023 Dec,Journal Article,10.1002/mabi.202300194,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37534769/,
37326828,"Hydrogels for Gasotransmitter Delivery: Nitric Oxide, Carbon Monoxide, and Hydrogen Sulfide.","Gasotransmitters, gaseous signaling molecules including nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H(2) S), maintain myriad physiological processes. Low levels of gasotransmitters are often associated with specific problems or diseases, so NO, CO, and H(2) S hold potential in treating bacterial infections, chronic wounds, myocardial infarction, ischemia, and various other diseases. However, their clinical applications as therapeutic agents are limited due to their gaseous nature, short half-life, and broad physiological roles. One route toward the greater application of gasotransmitters in medicine is through localized delivery. Hydrogels are attractive biomedical materials for the controlled release of embedded therapeutics as they are typically biocompatible, possess high water content, have tunable mechanical properties, and are injectable in certain cases. Hydrogel-based gasotransmitter delivery systems began with NO, and hydrogels for CO and H(2) S have appeared more recently. In this review, the biological importance of gasotransmitters is highlighted, and the fabrication of hydrogel materials is discussed, distinguishing between methods used to physically encapsulate small molecule gasotransmitter donor compounds or chemically tether them to a hydrogel scaffold. The release behavior and potential therapeutic applications of gasotransmitter-releasing hydrogels are also detailed. Finally, the authors envision the future of this field and describe challenges moving forward.",Macromolecular bioscience,2024 Jan,Journal Article; Review,10.1002/mabi.202300138,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37326828/,
36116010,Elastic and Conductive Melanin/Poly(Vinyl Alcohol) Composite Hydrogel for Enhancing Repair Effect on Myocardial Infarction.,"Heart failure caused by acute myocardial infarction (MI) still remains the main cause of death worldwide. Development of conductive hydrogels provided a promising approach for the treatment of myocardial infarction. However, the therapeutic potential of these hydrogels is still limited by material toxicity or low conductivity. The latter directly affects the coupling and the propagation of electrical signals between cells. Here, a functional conductive hydrogel by combining hydrophilic and biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) with conductive melanin nanoparticles under physical crosslinking conditions is prepared. The composite hydrogels prepared by a facile fabrication process of five freeze/thaw cycles possessed satisfying mechanical properties and conductivity close to those of the natural heart. The physical properties and biocompatibility are evaluated in vitro experiments, showing that the introduction of melanin particles successfully improved the elasticity, conductivity, and cell adhesion of PVA hydrogel. In vivo, the composite hydrogels can enhance the cardiac repair effect by reducing MI area, slowing down ventricular wall thinning, and promoting the vascularization of infarct area in MI rat model. It is believed that the melanin/PVA composite hydrogel may be a suitable candidate material for MI repair.",Macromolecular bioscience,2022 Dec,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/mabi.202200223,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36116010/,
35920099,Antioxidant Silk Fibroin Composite Hydrogel for Rapid Healing of Diabetic Wound.,"Wound healing is a complex process requiring multiple biological pathways and chemical responses to be activated and synchronized to recover tissue integrity. In normal physiological circumstances, the epidermal barrier restoration process through new tissue formation is highly efficient. However, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), attack of pathogenic microorganisms, and high glucose level delay the normal healing process in diabetic patients. The successful treatment of diabetic wounds requires efficient strategies to control oxidative stress, promoting angiogenesis, re-epithelialization, and collagen deposition. In this study, a composite hydrogel for rapid wound healing in diabetic condition is developed by the amalgamation of hypolipidemic property of silk fibroin (SF), antioxidant property of melanin, and therapeutic effect of berberine. Studies have revealed that cross-linked mesoporous morphology of hydrogel matrix facilitates slow release of berberine to impart long-term therapeutic effects at wound site. The composite hydrogel formulation is biocompatible, stimulates effective migration of fibroblast cells, and control oxidative stress under in vitro conditions. The hydrogel served as scaffold for tissue re-epithelialization and promotes wound repair in diabetic type I Wistar rat model. This study demonstrates the ability of berberine- loaded SF-melanin composite hydrogel as a potential dressing formulation for wound healing in diabetic conditions.",Macromolecular bioscience,2022 Sep,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/mabi.202200097,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35920099/,
35089646,Recent Advances in Bioinspired Hydrogels with Environment-Responsive Characteristics for Biomedical Applications.,"The development of hydrogel-integrated soft materials via the incorporation of therapeutic medicines into biocompatible hydrogels, serving as host, will significantly contribute to advances in medical diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, intelligent hydrogels having the ability to respond to local environmental conditions offer a promising approach for the development of novel solutions in the biomedical field. Bioinspired intelligent hydrogels are now becoming a potentially powerful biomaterial class for tissue engineering, drug delivery, and medical device. Recent advances include bioinspired intelligent hydrogels that possess unique mechanical and optical properties as a result of their nature-inspired complex-structured design. This review highlights the latest advances in intelligent bionic hydrogels, as well as strategies targeting smart response of their characteristics across multiple dimensions (such as temperature, light, pH, among others).

34773718,Molecularly Imprinted Hydrogels Selective to Ribavirin as New Drug Delivery Systems to Improve Efficiency of Antiviral Nucleoside Analogue: A Proof-of-Concept Study with Influenza A Virus.,"This study describes the synthesis and evaluation of different imprinted hydrogels using ribavirin as template molecule. Ribavirin serves as a model molecule because it possesses a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against RNA viruses, which are expected as emerging viruses. The choice of monomers enables to stabilize the pre-polymerization complex and to synthesize biocompatible polymers. Predictive studies as well as experimental works conclude similar results on best ribavirin:monomers ratios. Thus, materials exhibit high selective cavities toward ribavirin. These affinities allow to show release profiles drastically different from the non-imprinted ones at two temperatures. The imprinted materials show a sustained profile able to release antiviral for more than 24 h. The hydrogels obtained are biocompatible with model cells retained, human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells. Cell viability is excellent and pro-inflammatory response is insignificant when imprinted polymers are incubated with cells. Finally, viral tests carried out on Influenza A infected lung cells show that imprinted delivery systems delivering 1 to 3 microg of antiviral have the same efficiency as a medium containing 30 microg mL(-1) of active agent. As a very interesting result, the molecularly imprinted polymers as drug delivery systems allow to increase the local concentration of antiviral, to improve their delivery when its bioavailability is low.",Macromolecular bioscience,2022 Feb,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/mabi.202100291,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34773718/,
34514730,Poly(glycerol sebacate)-co-poly(ethylene glycol)/Gelatin Hybrid Hydrogels as Biocompatible Biomaterials for Cell Proliferation and Spreading.,"Synthetic polymers have been widely employed to prepare hydrogels for biomedical applications, such as cell culture, drug delivery, and tissue engineering. However, the activity of cells cultured in the synthetic polymer-based hydrogels faces the challenges of limited cell proliferation and spreading compared to cells cultured in natural polymer-based hydrogels. To address this concern, a hybrid hydrogel strategy is demonstrated by incorporating thiolated gelatin (GS) into the norbornene-functionalized poly (glycerol sebacate)-co-polyethylene glycol (Nor_PGS-co-PEG, NPP) network to prepare highly biocompatible NPP/GS_UV hydrogels after the thiol-ene photo-crosslinking reaction. The GS introduces several desirable features (i.e., enhanced water content, enlarged pore size, increased mechanical property, and more cell adhesion sites) to the NPP/GS_UV hydrogels, facilitating the cell proliferation and spreading inside the network. Thus, the highly biocompatible NPP/GS_UV hydrogels are promising materials for cell encapsulation and tissue engineering applications. Taken together, the hybrid hydrogel strategy is demonstrated as a powerful approach to fabricate hydrogels with a highly friendly environment for cell culture, expanding the biomedical applications of hydrogels.",Macromolecular bioscience,2021 Dec,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/mabi.202100248,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34514730/,
33871152,Design of an Injectable Polypeptide Hydrogel Depot Containing the Immune Checkpoint Blocker Anti-PD-L1 and Doxorubicin to Enhance Antitumor Combination Therapy.,"Combination therapy can be used to enhance the therapeutic response and decrease side effects during cancer treatment. In this study, a system is developed to locally deliver the immune checkpoint blockade antibody targeting programmed death-ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1 or aPD-L1) and doxorubicin (Dox), by an injectable, biocompatible polypeptide hydrogel as a drug depot. The localized and sustained release of Dox after the intratumoral injection of the co-loaded hydrogel induces immunogenic tumor cell death, thus promoting an antitumor immunological response. The tumor inhibitory effect is significantly enhanced by the simultaneous release of aPD-L1 at the tumor site thanks to its action on the inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and restoration of the tumor-killing effect of cytotoxic T cells. Treatment of the B16F10 melanoma model with the aPD-L1 and Dox co-loaded hydrogel leads to a remarkable inhibition of tumor progression and prolongation of animal survival.",Macromolecular bioscience,2021 Jun,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/mabi.202100049,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33871152/,
33241641,Hydrogel-Forming Microneedles: Current Advancements and Future Trends.,"In this focused progress review, the recent developments and trends of hydrogel-forming microneedles (HFMs) and potential future directions are presented. Previously, microneedles (solid, hollow, coated, and dissolving microneedles) have primarily been used to enhance the effectiveness of transdermal drug delivery to facilitate a wide range of applications such as vaccinations and antibiotic delivery. However, the recent trend in microneedle development has resulted in microneedles formed from hydrogels which have the ability to offer transdermal drug delivery and, due to the hydrogel swelling nature, passively extract interstitial fluid from the skin, meaning they have the potential to be used for biocompatible minimally invasive monitoring devices. Thus, in this review, these recent trends are highlighted, which consolidate microneedle design considerations, hydrogel formulations, fabrication processes, applications of HFMs and the potential future opportunities for utilizing HFMs for personalized healthcare monitoring and treatment.",Macromolecular bioscience,2021 Feb,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",10.1002/mabi.202000307,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33241641/,
32734673,Design of Hydrolytically Degradable Polyethylene Glycol Crosslinkers for Facile Control of Hydrogel Degradation.,"Hydrogels, whose degradability can be controlled while also preserving cell viability or biomolecule stability, are in demand. Degradable polyethylene glycol crosslinkers are hydrolytically designed for use in hydrogels. Degradation is controlled by crosslinker chemical structure, such as introducing local hydrophobicity, steric hindrance, or electron-withdrawing moieties near a degradable ester moiety. Hydrogels made using these crosslinkers have gelation times from 1 to 22 min, storage moduli from 3 to 10 kPa, mesh sizes from 10 to 13 nm, and degradation times from 18 h to 16 d. However, when reaction conditions are modified to achieve similar gelation time, hydrogels have similar initial properties but preserve the wide range of degradation times. All crosslinkers support high cell viability upon hydrogel encapsulation or exposure to leachables and degradation products. This innovation in controlling degradation can help realize the hydrogels' potential for drug delivery or as matrices for cell encapsulation and transplantation.",Macromolecular bioscience,2020 Oct,Journal Article,10.1002/mabi.202000085,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32734673/,
30395416,Sustained Protein Release from a Core-Shell Drug Carrier System Comprised of Mesoporous Nanoparticles and an Injectable Hydrogel.,"The manufacture of a biocompatible carrier for controlled delivery of bioactive compounds is described. This carrier is composed of a mesoporous silica nanoparticle as core that is homogenously distributed in an injectable hydrogel. For the synthesis of nanoparticles, a one step sol-gel method is developed to produce pores with the range of 100 nm. BMP2 and Fluorescein-conjugated bovine serum albumin is used as proteinaceous agents for measuring release, and is loaded into mesoporous silica nanoparticles at the optimum conditions of 48 h incubation period using 1:10 ratio of protein to nanoparticles. The release of proteins from either mesoporous nanoparticles or hydrogel individually involves a burst release stage, however the release from the core/shell carrier designed in this study follows a zero order kinetic. In summary, this biomaterial may be favorable for delivery of bioactive compounds such as BMP2 for a range of applications including bone tissue regeneration.",Macromolecular bioscience,2018 Dec,Journal Article,10.1002/mabi.201800201,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30395416/,
28714139,Simple Radical Polymerization of Poly(Alginate-Graft-N-Isopropylacrylamide) Injectable Thermoresponsive Hydrogel with the Potential for Localized and Sustained Delivery of Stem Cells and Bioactive Molecules.,"In this study, thermoresponsive copolymers that are fully injectable, biocompatible, and biodegradable and are synthesized via graft copolymerization of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) onto alginate using a free-radical reaction are presented. This new synthesis method does not involve multisteps or associated toxicity issues, and has the potential to reduce scale-up difficulties. Chemical and physical analyses verify the resultant graft copolymer structure. The lower critical solution temperature, which is a characteristic of sol-gel transition, is observed at 32  degrees C. The degradation properties indicate suitable degradation kinetics for drug delivery and bone tissue engineering applications. The synthesized P(Alg-g-NIPAAm) hydrogel is noncytotoxic with both human osteosarcoma (MG63) cells and porcine bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (pBMSCs). pBMSCs encapsulated in the P(Alg-g-NIPAAm) hydrogel remain viable, show uniform distribution within the injected hydrogel, and undergo osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation under appropriate culture conditions. Furthermore, for the first time, this work will explore the influence of alginate viscosity on the viscoelastic properties of the resulting copolymer hydrogels, which influences the rate of medical device formation and subsequent drug release. Together the results of this study indicate that the newly synthesized P(Alg-g-NIPAAm) hydrogel has potential to serve as a versatile and improved injectable platform for drug delivery and bone tissue engineering applications.",Macromolecular bioscience,2017 Nov,Journal Article,10.1002/mabi.201700118,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28714139/,
27762493,Quinacrine Mediated Sensitization of Glioblastoma (GBM) Cells to TRAIL through MMP-Sensitive PEG Hydrogel Carriers.,"Overcoming drug resistance is a major challenge for cancer therapy. Tumor necrosis factor alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a potent therapeutic as an activator of apoptosis, particularly in tumor but not in healthy cells. However, its efficacy is limited by the resistance of tumor cell populations to the therapeutic substance. Here, we have addressed this limitation through the development of a controlled release system, matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP)-sensitive and arg-gly-asp-ser (RGDS) peptide functionalized poly (ethylene-glycol) (PEG) particles which are synthesized via visible-light-induced water-in-water emulsion polymerization. Quinacrine (QC), a recently discovered TRAIL sensitizer drug, is loaded into the hydrogel carriers and the influence of this system on the apoptosis of a malignant type of brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), has been investigated in detail. The results suggest that MMP-sensitive particles are cytocompatible and superior to promote TRAIL-induced apoptosis in GBM cells when loaded with QC. Compared to QC and TRAIL alone, combination of QC-loaded PEG hydrogel and TRAIL demonstrates synergistic apoptotic inducing behavior. Furthermore, QC-loaded particles, but not QC or PEG-hydrogels alone, enhance apoptosis as is measured through expression of apoptosis-related genes. This system is promising to significantly improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs and suggests a combination treatment for GBM therapy.",Macromolecular bioscience,2017 Feb,Journal Article,10.1002/mabi.201600267,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27762493/,

The assembled nanostructure is confirmed by FESEM and optical microscopy. The assembly is not hindered when a protein (insulin) is incorporated within the nanoparticles as an active ingredient. MTS cytotoxicity tests on SW-620 cell lines show that the peptides, copolymers, and peptide-copolymer conjugates are biocompatible. The methodology of self-assembled nanoparticle fibers and 3D scaffolds is intended to combine the advantages of a flexible hydrogel scaffold with the versatility of controlled release nanoparticles to offer unprecedented ability to incorporate desired drug(s) within a self-assembled scaffold system with individual control over the release of each drug.",Macromolecular bioscience,2014 Jun,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",10.1002/mabi.201300569,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24610743/,
