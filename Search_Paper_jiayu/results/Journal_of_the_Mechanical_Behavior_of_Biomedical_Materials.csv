30735979,Tough robust dual responsive nanocomposite hydrogel as controlled drug delivery carrier of asprin.,"Smart mechanical strong hydrogels have gained increasing attention in the last decade. A novel tough robust biocompatible and dual pH- and temperature- responsive poly (N-isopropylacrylamide)/clay (Laponite XLS)/gold nanoparticles (Au-S-S NPs)/caboxymethyl chitosan (CMCTs) nanocomposite hydrogel was synthesized by a facile one-pot in situ free radical polymerization, using clay and Au-S-S NPs as the cross-linkers instead of toxic organic molecules. By tuning the crucial factors, concentration of Au-S-S NPs, CMCTs and clay, the obtained hydrogels exhibited the highest tensile stress of 535.5 kPa at the breaking deformation of 1579.5%. Furthermore, these synthesized hydrogels were tough enough and simultaneously owned a fast recoverability after unloaded in 15 min at room temperature. Moreover, effects of the above factors on swelling and swelling-shrinking behaviors of the prepared hydrogels were investigated in detail. In addition, these designed hydrogels also possessed a controlled drug release property of asprin by adjusting their inner crosslink density. Owing to this property, they could be used as the potential drug delivery carriers in future.",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 Apr,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1751-6161(18)31251-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30735979/,
29571114,Mechanically strong dual responsive nanocomposite double network hydrogel for controlled drug release of asprin.,"Mechanically strong dual/multi-stimuli-responsive smart hydrogels have attracted extensive attention in recent years. A novel tough, mechanical strong and biocompatible dual pH- and temperature- responsive poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) /clay (laponite XLG)/carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCTs) /genipin nanocomposite double network hydrogel was synthesized through a facile, one-pot free radical polymerization initiated by the ultraviolet light, using clay and the natural molecular-genipin as the cross-linkers instead of toxic organic molecules. Crucial factors, the content of CMCTs, clay and genipin, for synthesizing the mechanical strong hydrogels were investigated. When the content of CMCTs, clay and genipin were 5 wt%, 33.3 wt% and 0.175 wt%, respectively (to the weight of N-isopropylacrylamide), these prepared hydrogels exhibited a high tensile strength of 137.9 kPa at the failure strain of 446.1%. Furthermore, the relationship between swelling and deswelling rate of the synthesized hydrogels and the above crucial factors were also studied. Besides, the synthesized hydrogels displayed a considerable controlled release property of asprin by tuning their inner crosslink density. Owing to this property, they may have great potential in the drug delivery systems.",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2018 Jun,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1751-6161(18)30269-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29571114/,
28850924,Reinforcing the inner phase of the filled hydrogels with CNTs alters drug release properties and human keratinocyte morphology: A study on the gelatin- tamarind gum filled hydrogels.,"The study reports the synthesis and characterization of gelatin-tamarind gum (TG) based filled hydrogels for drug delivery applications. In this study, three different types of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were incorporated within the dispersed TG phase of the filled hydrogels. The prepared hydrogels were thoroughly characterised using bright field microscope, FESEM, FTIR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimeter, and mechanical tester. The swelling and the drug (salicylic acid) release properties of the filled hydrogels were also evaluated. The micrographs revealed the formation of biphasic systems. The internal phase appeared as agglomerates, and the CNTs were confined within the dispersed TG phase. FTIR and XRD studies revealed that CNTs promoted associative interactions among the components of the hydrogel, which promoted the formation of large crystallite size. The mechanical study indicated better resistance to the breakdown of the architecture of the CNT-containing filled hydrogels. Drug release studies, both passive and iontophoretic, suggested that the non-Fickian diffusion of the drug was prevalent during its release from hydrogel matrices. The prepared hydrogels were cytocompatible with human keratinocytes. The results suggested the probable use of such hydrogels in wound healing, tissue engineering and drug delivery applications.",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2017 Nov,Journal Article,S1751-6161(17)30369-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28850924/,
25549573,"Stearate organogel-gelatin hydrogel based bigels: physicochemical, thermal, mechanical characterizations and in vitro drug delivery applications.","Over the past decade, researchers have been trying to develop alternative gel based formulations in comparison to the traditional hydrogels and emulgels. In this perspective, bigels were synthesized by mixing gelatin hydrogel and stearic acid based organogel by hot emulsification method. Two types of bigels were synthesized using sesame oil and soy bean oil based stearate organogels. Gelatin based emulgels prepared using sesame oil and soy bean oil were used as the controls. Microscopic studies revealed that the bigels contained aggregates of droplets, whereas, emulgels showed dispersed droplets within the continuum phase. The emulgels showed higher amount of leaching of oils, whereas, the leaching of the internal phase was negligible from the bigels. Presence of organogel matrix within the bigels was confirmed by XRD, FTIR and DSC methods. Bigels showed higher mucoadhesive and mechanical properties compared to emulgels. Cyclic creep-recovery and stress relaxation studies confirmed the viscoelastic nature of the formulations. Four elemental Burger's model was employed to analyze the cyclic creep-recovery data. Cyclic creep-recovery studies suggested that the deformation of the bigels were lower due to the presence of the organogels within its structure. The formulations showed almost 100% recovery after the creep stage and can be explained by the higher elastic nature of the formulations. Stress relaxation study showed that the relaxation time was higher in the emulgels as compared to the bigels. Also, the % relaxation was higher in emulgels suggesting its fluid dominant nature. The in vitro biocompatibility of the bigels was checked using human epidermal keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). Both emulgels and bigels were biocompatible in nature. The in vitro drug (ciprofloxacin) release behavior indicated non-Fickian diffusion of the drug from the matrices. The drug release showed good antimicrobial effect against Escherichia coli. Based on the results, it was concluded that the developed bigels may have huge potential to be used as alternatives to emulgels.",Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2015 Mar,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1751-6161(14)00378-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25549573/,
