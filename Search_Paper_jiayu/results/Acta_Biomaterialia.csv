39461689,Biocompatible chitin-based Janus hydrogel membranes for periodontal repair.,"Periodontal defects caused by severe periodontitis are a widespread issue globally. Guided tissue regeneration (GTR) using barrier membranes for alveolar bone repair is a common clinical treatment. However, most commercially available collagen barrier membranes are expensive and lack the antibacterial properties essential for effective bone regeneration. Herein, we report a natural polysaccharide chitin hydrogel barrier membrane with a Janus structure (ChT-PDA-p-HAP), featuring high antibacterial and protein-repelling activity on the outer side and good osteogenesis ability on the inner side. This multifunctional membrane is fabricated though a three-step process: (i) dissolution and regeneration of chitin, (ii) co-deposition with polydopamine (PDA) and poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (pSBMA), and (iii) coating with gelatin-hydroxyapatite (gelatin-HAP). In vitro cell experiments demonstrated the membrane's high biocompatibility and significant osteogenic activity. In vivo implantation in rats with periodontal defects revealed that the cemento-enamel junction index of the ChT-PDA-p-HAP membrane (1.165 mm) was superior to that of the commercial Bio-Gide(R) membrane (1.350 mm). This work presents a method for fabricating a chitin-based Janus barrier membrane, potentially expanding the use of chitin in tissue engineering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study introduces a Janus hydrogel membrane based on chitin, tailored for guided tissue regeneration in periodontal defects. By combining antibacterial properties and osteogenic capabilities in a single membrane, the ChT-PDA-p-HAP membrane represents a significant advancement over traditional collagen barriers. Its outer surface, enhanced by Cu(2+) and PDA-pSBMA coatings, resists bacterial colonization and protein adhesion effectively, while the inner side, coated with gelatin-HAP, promotes robust bone formation. In vitro experiments demonstrate high biocompatibility and substantial osteogenic differentiation, while in vivo testing in rat models confirms good therapeutic efficacy compared to commercial membranes. This multifunctional approach not only utilizes chitin's abundant natural resource but also integrates simple coating techniques to enhance therapeutic outcomes in periodontal tissue engineering, offering promising avenues for broader biomedical applications.",Acta biomaterialia,2024 Dec,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(24)00630-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39461689/,
39260811,Hydrogen-releasing magnesium hydrogel mitigates post laminectomy epidural fibrosis through inhibition of neutrophil extracellular traps.,"Epidural fibrosis is a primary contributor to the failure of laminectomy surgeries, leading to the development of failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). Post-laminectomy, neutrophils infiltrate the surgical site, generating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that contribute to epidural fibrosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a pivotal role in mediating NETs formation. Molecular hydrogen, recognized for its selective antioxidant properties and biosafety, emerges as a potential therapeutic gas in suppressing epidural fibrosis. In this study, we developed an in-situ hydrogen release hydrogel that inhibits the formation of NETs and mitigates epidural scarring. Biodegradable magnesium (Mg) microspheres served as a hydrogen source, coated with PLGA to regulate hydrogen release. These microspheres (Mg@PLGA) were then incorporated into a PLGA-PEG-PLGA thermosensitive hydrogel (Mg@PLGA@Gel), providing a surgical implant for sustained, long-term hydrogen release. In vitro experiments confirmed the biocompatibility of the system, demonstrating that hydrogen produced by Mg@PLGA effectively neutralizes neutrophil intracellular ROS and inhibits NETs formation. Histological analyses, including H&E staining, MRI, Masson staining, and immunohistochemistry, collectively indicate that Mg@PLGA@Gel is biocompatible and effectively inhibits epidural fibrosis post-laminectomy. Furthermore, Mg@PLGA@Gel inhibits ROS accumulation and NETs formation at the surgical site. These findings suggest that Mg@PLGA@Gel ensures continuous, therapeutic hydrogen concentration, providing relief from epidural fibrosis in a laminectomy mouse model.

38719158,Fighting bacteria with bacteria: A biocompatible living hydrogel patch for combating bacterial infections and promoting wound healing.,"Bacterial infections are among the most critical global health challenges that seriously threaten the security of human. To address this issue, a biocompatible engineered living hydrogel patch was developed by co-embedding engineered photothermal bacteria (E(M)), photosensitizer (porphyrin) and reactive oxygen species amplifier (laccase) in a protein hydrogel. Remarkably, the genetice engineered bacteria can express melanin granules in vivo and this allows them to exhibit photothermal response upon being exposed to NIR-II laser (1064 nm) irradiation. Besides, electrostatically adhered tetramethylpyridinium porphyrin (TMPyP) on the bacterial surface and encapsulated laccase (Lac) in protein gel can generate highly toxic singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) and hydroxyl radical (.OH) in the presence of visible light and lignin, respectively. Interestingly, the engineered bacteria hydrogel patch (E(M)TL@Gel) was successfully applied in synergistic photothermal, photodynamic and chemodynamic therapy, in which it was able to efficiently treat bacterial infection in mouse wounds and enhance wound healing. This work demonstrates the concept of ""fighting bacteria with bacteria"" combining bacterial engineering and material engineering into an engineered living hydrogel path that can synergistically boost the therapeutic outcome. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Genetically engineered bacteria produce melanin granules in vivo, exhibiting remarkable photothermal properties. These bacteria, along with a photosensitizer (TMPyP) and a reactive oxygen species amplifier (laccase), are incorporated into a biocompatible protein hydrogel patch. Under visible light, the patch generates toxic singlet oxygen ((1)O(2)) and hydroxyl radical (.OH), demonstrates outstanding synergistic effects in photothermal, photodynamic, and chemodynamic therapy, effectively treating bacterial infections and promoting wound healing in mice.",Acta biomaterialia,2024 Jun,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(24)00230-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38719158/,
38447811,Telodendrimer functionalized hydrogel platform for sustained antibiotics release in infection control.,"Wound infection commonly causes delayed healing, especially in the setting of chronic wounds. Local release of antibiotics is considered a viable approach to treat chronic wounds. We have developed a versatile telodendrimer (TD) platform for efficient loading of charged antibiotic molecules via a combination of multivalent and synergistic charge and hydrophobic interactions. The conjugation of TD in biocompatible hydrogel allows for topical application to provide sustained antibiotic release. Notably, a drug loading capacity as high as 20 % of the drug-to-resin dry weight ratio can be achieved. The payload content (PC) and release profile of the various antibiotics can be optimized by fine-tuning TD density and valency in hydrogel based on the charge and hydrophobic features of the drug, e.g., polymyxin B (PMB), gentamycin (GM), and daptomycin (Dap), for effective infection control. We have shown that hydrogel with moderately reduced TD density demonstrates a more favorable release profile than hydrogel with higher TD density. Antibiotics loaded in TD hydrogel have comparable antimicrobial potency and reduced cytotoxicity compared to the free antibiotics due to a prolonged, controlled drug release profile. In a mouse model of skin and soft tissue infection, the subcutaneous administration of PMB-loaded TD hydrogel effectively eliminated the bacterial burden. Overall, these results suggest that engineerable TD hydrogels have great potential as a topical treatment to control infection for wound healing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Wound infection causes a significant delay in the wound healing process, which results in a significant financial and resource burden to the healthcare system. PEGA-telodendrimer (TD) resin hydrogel is an innovative and versatile platform that can be fine-tuned to efficiently encapsulate different antibiotics by altering charged and hydrophobic structural moieties. Additionally, this platform is advantageous as the TD density in the resin can also be fine-tuned to provide the desired antibiotic payload release profile. Sustained antibiotics release through optimization of TD density provides a prolonged therapeutic window and reduces burst release-induced cytotoxicity compared to conventional antibiotics application. Studies in a preclinical mouse model of bacteria-induced skin and soft tissue infection demonstrated promising therapeutic efficacy as evidenced by effective infection control and prolonged antibacterial efficacy of antibiotics-loaded PEGA-TD resin. In conclusion, the PEGA-TD resin platform provides a highly customizable approach for effective antibiotics release with significant potential for topical application to treat various bacterial wound infections to promote wound healing.",Acta biomaterialia,2024 Apr 1,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(24)00115-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38447811/,
36640949,Electrically responsive release of proteins from conducting polymer hydrogels.,"Electrically modulated delivery of proteins provides an avenue to target local tissues specifically and tune the dose to the application. This approach prolongs and enhances activity at the target site whilst reducing off-target effects associated with systemic drug delivery. The work presented here explores an electrically active composite material comprising of a biocompatible hydrogel, gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and a conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene), generating a conducting polymer hydrogel. In this paper, the key characteristics of electroactivity, mechanical properties, and morphology are characterized using electrochemistry techniques, atomic force, and scanning electron microscopy. Cytocompatibility is established through exposure of human cells to the materials. By applying different electrical-stimuli, the short-term release profiles of a model protein can be controlled over 4 h, demonstrating tunable delivery patterns. This is followed by extended-release studies over 21 days which reveal a bimodal delivery mechanism influenced by both GelMA degradation and electrical stimulation events. This data demonstrates an electroactive and cytocompatible material suitable for the delivery of protein payloads over 3 weeks. This material is well suited for use as a treatment delivery platform in tissue engineering applications where targeted and spatio-temporal controlled delivery of therapeutic proteins is required. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Growth factor use in tissue engineering typically requires sustained and tunable delivery to generate optimal outcomes. While conducting polymer hydrogels (CPH) have been explored for the electrically responsive release of small bioactives, we report on a CPH capable of releasing a protein payload in response to electrical stimulus. The composite material combines the benefits of soft hydrogels acting as a drug reservoir and redox-active properties from the conducting polymer enabling electrical responsiveness. The CPH is able to sustain protein delivery over 3 weeks, with electrical stimulus used to modulate release. The described material is well suited as a treatment delivery platform to deliver large quantities of proteins in applications where spatio-temporal delivery patterns are paramount.",Acta biomaterialia,2023 Mar 1,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(23)00014-4,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36640949/,
36596433,Injectable spontaneous hydrogen-releasing hydrogel for long-lasting alleviation of osteoarthritis.,"Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) amplifies pro-inflammatory pathways and exacerbates immune responses, and is a key factor in the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Therapeutic hydrogen gas (H(2)) with antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects, has a potential for OA alleviation, but the targeted delivery and sustained release of H(2) are still challenging. Herein, we develop an injectable calcium boride nanosheets (CBN) loaded hydrogel platform (CBN@GelDA hydrogel) as a high-payload and sustainable H(2) precursor for OA treatment. The CBN@GelDA hydrogel could maintain constant physiological pH conditions which further promotes more H(2) release than the CBN alone and lasts more than one week. The biocompatibility of this hydrogel with macrophages and chondrocytes is effectively enhanced. The experiments show that the CBN@GelDA hydrogel holds the ROS scavenging ability, reducing the expression of related inflammatory cytokines, lessening M1 macrophages but stimulating M2 phenotype, and thereby decreasing chondrocyte apoptosis, which facilitates to breaking of the vicious circle of OA progression. Furthermore, a single-time injection of the CBN@GelDA hydrogel markedly reduces joint destruction in OA rats. From what has been discussed above, this injectable spontaneous H(2)-releasing hydrogel is promising for OA treatment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Oxidative stress and inflammation play the key role in the occurrence and development of osteoarthritis (OA). The system of a hydrogel loaded with H(2) precursor calcium boride nanosheet (CBN), which is the first to use as an H(2) precursor, integrates superior injectable and biocompatible of hydrogel and the selection of antioxidant properties of H(2). This system can improve H(2) release behavior and achieve a single injection into the articular cavity to alleviate the progression of OA in rats. This study of the combination of a convenient long-acting injectable hydrogel and a safe therapeutic gas is of great value for improving the quality of life of clinical patients.",Acta biomaterialia,2023 Mar 1,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(22)00868-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36596433/,
36584800,Construction of adhesive and bioactive silk fibroin hydrogel for treatment of spinal cord injury.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) often causes severe and permanent disabilities due to the complexity of injury progression. The promising methods are generally based on tissue engineering technology using biocompatible hydrogels to achieve SCI repair. However, hydrogels are commonly incapable of close contact with the damaged spinal cord stumps and fail to support neural regeneration in SCI. Therefore, it is still a challenge to achieve stable contact with the transected nerve stumps and accelerate neural regeneration in the lesion microenvironment. Here, an in situ forming glycidyl methacrylated silk fibroin/ laminin-acrylate (SF-GMA/LM-AC) hydrogel was fabricated for SCI repair. The polymer chains formed a network quickly after ultraviolet (UV)-light trigger, in topological entanglement with the spinal cord, stitching the hydrogel and wet tissues together like a suture at the molecular scale. The SF-GMA/LM-AC hydrogel also provided a favorable environment for the growth of cells due to the incorporation of LM-AC. Compared with physical entrapment of LM, LM-AC immobilized in the hydrogel by covalent technology provided better microenvironments for neural stem cells (NSCs) growth. The repair of complete transection SCI in rats demonstrated that this hydrogel guided and promoted neural regeneration over 8 weeks, leading to hind limb locomotion recovery. This adhesive and bioactive SF-GMA/LM-AC hydrogel may open many opportunities in various therapeutic indications, including SCI. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Many materials have been developed for building transplanted scaffolds, but it is still a challenge to fabricate bioactive scaffolds and adhesion to wet tissues. In this study, we successfully developed an in situ forming SF-GMA/LM-AC hydrogel for SCI repair. This in situ forming hydrogel formed significant adhesion to the native spinal cord, stitching hydrogel and tissue together like a suture at the molecular scale. In addition, covalent immobilized LM-AC was used as the contact guidance biochemical cues for axonal outgrowth and had much better bioactive effects than physically entangled LM. Moreover, this universal strategy would open an avenue to fabricate adhesive and bioactive hydrogel for various disease treatments including SCI.",Acta biomaterialia,2023 Mar 1,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(22)00858-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36584800/,
36526241,Design and characterization of matrix metalloproteinase-responsive hydrogels for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases.,"Enzyme-responsive hydrogels, formed by step growth photopolymerization of biscysteine peptide linkers with alkene functionalized polyethylene glycol, provide interesting opportunities as biomaterials and drug delivery systems. In this study, we developed stimuli-responsive, specific, and cytocompatible hydrogels for delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. We designed peptide linkers with optimized sensitivity towards matrix metalloproteinases, a family of proteolytic enzymes overexpressed in the extracellular matrix of the skin during inflammation. The peptide linkers were crosslinked with branched 4-arm and 8-arm polyethylene glycols by thiol-norbornene photopolymerization, leading to the formation of a hydrogel network, in which the anti-inflammatory Janus kinase inhibitor tofacitinib citrate was incorporated. The hydrogels were extensively characterized by physical properties, in vitro release studies, cytocompatibility with fibroblasts, and anti-inflammatory efficacy testing in both an atopic dermatitis-like keratinocyte assay and an activated T-cell assay. The drug release was studied after single and multiple-time exposure to matrix metalloproteinase 9 to mimic inflammatory flare-ups. Drug release was found to be triggered by matrix metalloproteinase 9 and to depend on type of crosslinker and of the polyethylene glycol polymer, due to differences in architecture and swelling behavior. Moreover, swollen hydrogels showed elastic properties similar to those of extracellular matrix proteins in the dermis. Cell studies revealed limited cytotoxicity when fibroblasts and keratinocytes were exposed to the hydrogels or their enzymatic cleavage products. Taken together, our results suggest multi-arm polyethylene glycol hydrogels as promising matrix metalloproteinase-responsive drug delivery systems, with potential in the treatment of inflammatory skin disease. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Smart responsive drug delivery systems such as matrix metalloproteinase-responsive hydrogels are excellent candidates for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases including psoriasis. Their release profile can be optimized to correspond to the patient's individual disease state by tuning formulation parameters and disease-related stimuli, providing personalized treatment solutions. However, insufficient cross-linking efficiency, low matrix metalloproteinase sensitivity, and undesirable drug release kinetics remain major challenges in the development of such drug delivery systems. In this study, we address shortcomings of previous work by designing peptide linkers with optimized sensitivity towards matrix metalloproteinases and high cross-linking efficiencies. We further provide a proof-of-concept for the usability of the hydrogels in inflammatory skin conditions by employing a drug release set-up simulating inflammatory flare-ups.",Acta biomaterialia,2023 Feb,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(22)00818-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36526241/,
36435442,Semaphorin 3A delivered by a rapidly polymerizing click hydrogel overcomes impaired implant osseointegration in a rat type 2 diabetes model.,"Semaphorin 3A (sema3A) is an osteoprotective factor that enhances bone formation while inhibiting osteoclast bone resorption. It is produced by rat calvarial osteoblasts cultured on grit-blasted/acid-etched microtextured (SLA) titanium surfaces at higher levels than on tissue culture polystyrene, suggesting that it may improve performance of titanium implants in vivo, particularly in conditions characterized by compromised bone quality. To test this, we established a clinically relevant type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rat model and used a non-toxic click hydrogel that rapidly polymerizes in situ (GEL) to provide localized controlled delivery of sema3A. In vitro studies confirmed that sema3A released from GEL was biologically active, increasing osteoblast differentiation of a pre-osteoblast cell-line. Whereas increased sema3A production was not observed in T2DM calvarial osteoblasts cultured on SLA, exogenous sema3A enhanced surface-induced osteoblast differentiation, indicating that it would be a viable candidate for in vivo use. Delivery of sema3A either by GEL or by local injection to bone defects enhanced osseointegration of SLA implants in the T2DM rats. Trabecular bone mass and bone-to-implant contact were decreased in T2DM rats compared to normal rats; sema3A delivered locally improved both parameters. These findings suggest that reduced trabecular bone contributes to poor osseointegration in T2DM patients and support GEL as a promising treatment option for sustained release of therapeutic doses of sema3A. Moreover, using this clinically translatable T2DM model and developing a biocompatible, Cu-free click chemistry hydrogel platform for the non-invasive delivery of therapeutics has major implications for regenerative medicine as a whole. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Osseointegration is compromised in patients with poor bone quality due to conditions like type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Previously, we showed that semaphorin 3A (sema3A) production is increased when human bone marrow stromal cells are cultured on titanium substrates that support osseointegration in vivo, suggesting it may enhance peri-implant osteogenesis in diabetes. Here we established a spontaneously developing T2DM rat model with clinical translatability and used it to assess sema3A effectiveness. Sema3A was delivered to the implant site via a novel copper-free click hydrogel, which has minimal swelling behavior and superior rheological properties. Osseointegration was successfully restored, and enhanced compared to burst release through injections. This study provides scientific evidence for using sema3A to treat impaired osseointegration in T2DM patients.",Acta biomaterialia,2023 Feb,Journal Article,S1742-7061(22)00757-7,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36435442/,
36152907,"A self-healing, magnetic and injectable biopolymer hydrogel generated by dual cross-linking for drug delivery and bone repair.","Injectable hydrogels based on various functional biocompatible materials have made rapid progress in the field of bone repair. In this study, a self-healing and injectable polysaccharide-based hydrogel was prepared for bone tissue engineering. The hydrogel was made of carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) and calcium pre-cross-linked oxidized gellan gum (OGG) cross-linked by the Schiff-base reaction. Meanwhile, magnetic hydroxyapatite/gelatin microspheres (MHGMs) were prepared by the emulsion cross-linking method. The antibacterial drugs, tetracycline hydrochloride (TH) and silver sulfadiazine (AgSD), were embedded into the MHGMs. To improve the mechanical and biological properties of the hydrogels, composite hydrogels were prepared by compounding hydroxyapatite (HAp) and drug-embedded MHGMs. The physical, chemical, mechanical and rheological properties of the composite hydrogels were characterized, as well as in vitro antibacterial tests and biocompatibility assays, respectively. Our results showed that the composite hydrogel with 6% (w/v) HAp and 10 mg/mL MHGMs exhibited good magnetic responsiveness, self-healing and injectability. Compared with the pure hydrogel, the composite hydrogel showed a 38.8% reduction in gelation time (196 to 120 s), a 65.6% decrease in swelling rate (39.4 to 13.6), a 51.9% increase in mass residual after degradation (79.5 to 120.8%), and a 143.7% increase in maximum compressive stress (53.6 to 130.6 KPa). In addition, this composite hydrogel showed good drug retardation properties and antibacterial effects against both S. aureus and E. coli. CCK-8 assay showed that composite hydrogel maintained high cell viability (> 87%) and rapid cell proliferation after 3 days, indicating that this smart hydrogel is expected to be an alternative scaffold for drug delivery and bone regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Biopolymer hydrogels have been considered as the promising materials for the treatment of tissue engineering and drug delivery. Injectable hydrogels with and self-healing properties and responsiveness to external stimuli have been extensively investigated as cell scaffolds and bone defects, due to their diversity and prolonged lifetime. Magnetism has also been involved in biomedical applications and played significant roles in targeted drug delivery and anti-cancer therapy. We speculate that development of dual cross-linked hydrogels basing biopolymers with multi-functionalities, such as injectable, self-healing, magnetic and anti-bacterial properties, would greatly broaden the application for bone tissue regeneration and drug delivery.",Acta biomaterialia,2022 Nov,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(22)00598-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36152907/,
35562007,Robust gelatin hydrogels for local sustained release of bupivacaine following spinal surgery.,"Adequate treatment of pain arising from spinal surgery is a major clinical challenge. Opioids are the mainstay of current treatment methods, but the frequency and severity of their side effects display a clear need for opioid-free analgesia. Local anesthetics have been encapsulated into sustained-release drug delivery systems to provide postoperative pain relief. However, these formulations are limited by rapid diffusion out of the surgical site. To overcome this limitation, we synthesized ring-shaped hydrogels incorporating bupivacaine, designed to be co-implanted with pedicle screws during spinal surgery. Hydrogels were prepared by riboflavin-mediated crosslinking of gelatin functionalized with tyramine moieties. Additionally, oxidized beta-cyclodextrin was introduced into the hydrogel formulation to form dynamic bonds with tyramine functionalities, which enables self-healing behavior and resistance to shear. Feasibility of hydrogel implantation combined with pedicle screws was qualitatively assessed in cadaveric sheep as a model for instrumented spinal surgery. The in-situ crystallization of bupivacaine within the hydrogel matrix provided a moderate burst decrease and sustained release that exceeded 72 hours in vitro. The use of bupivacaine crystals decreased drug-induced cytotoxicity in vitro compared to bupivacaine HCl. Thus, the presented robust hydrogel formulation provides promising properties to enable the stationary release of non-opioid analgesics following spinal surgery. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Currently, postoperative pain following spinal surgery is mainly treated with opioids. However, the use of opioids is associated with several side effects including addiction. Here we developed robust and cytocompatible gelatin hydrogels, prepared via riboflavin-mediated photocrosslinking, that can withstand orthopedic implantation. The implantability was confirmed in cadaveric instrumented spinal surgery. Further, hydrogels were loaded with bupivacaine crystals to provide sustained release beyond 72 hours in vitro. The use of crystallized bupivacaine decreased cytotoxicity compared to bupivacaine HCl. The present formulation can aid in enabling opioid-free analgesia following instrumented spinal surgery.",Acta biomaterialia,2022 Jul 1,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(22)00276-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35562007/,
35429669,NIR-activated multi-hit therapeutic Ag(2)S quantum dot-based hydrogel for healing of bacteria-infected wounds.,"Hydrogel dressings are highly biocompatible and can maintain a moist wound environment, suggesting constructing an efficient multi-modal antibacterial hydrogel platform is a promising strategy for treating bacterial wound infections. In this work, a composite Ag(2)S quantum dot/mSiO(2) NPs hydrogel (NP hydrogel) with antibacterial ability was constructed by incorporating Ag(2)S quantum dots (QDs) modified by mesoporous silica (mSiO(2)) into the network structure of 3-(trimethoxylmethosilyl) propyl methacrylate based on free radical polymerization. The NP hydrogel showed outstanding controllable photothermal and photodynamic characteristics under 808 nm near infrared (NIR) light irradiation, with a photothermal conversion efficiency of 57.3%. Additionally, the release of Ag(+) could be controlled by the inherent volume change of the NP hydrogel made of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) and acrylamide (AAm) during NIR laser exposure, with the embedded Ag(2)S QDs working as a reservoir to release Ag(+) continuously from the hydrogel matrix to achieve bactericidal activity. The synergetic effects between hyperthermia, radical oxygen species, and Ag(+) released under NIR radiation endowed the NP hydrogel with prominent antibacterial properties against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with an inhibition rate of 99.7% and 99.8%, respectively. In vivo wound healing experiments indicated that the NP hydrogel could enhance bacterial clearance, increase collagen coverage area and up-regulate VEGF expression, exhibiting high biocompatibility. Overall, this study proposed an efficient and highly biocompatible multi-modal therapeutic nanohydrogel, opening up a new way for developing broad-spectrum antibacterial wound dressings to treat bacterial wound infections. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Bacterial wound infection is still one of the most difficult medical problems. In this work, a stimulating NIR-responsive hydrogel encapsulating functional Ag(2)S QDs was prepared, which showed high photothermal conversion efficiency (57.3%) and outstanding antibacterial ability under 808 nm NIR laser, killing 99.7% and 99.8% of E. coli and MRSA in 4 min, respectively. During NIR light irradiation, the release rate of Ag(+) could be regulated by the intrinsic volume transition of the hydrogel, leading to remarkable antibacterial properties in vitro and in vivo under the combined action of hyperthermia, radical oxygen species and Ag(+) released.

35421616,Disulfide-Mediated Elongation of Amyloid Fibrils of alpha-Synuclein For Use in Producing Self-Healing Hydrogel and Dye-Absorbing Aerogel.,"Due to their mechanical robustness, biocompatibility, and nanoscale size, amyloid fibrils (AFs) have been considered as a potential nanomaterial for biological applications. Unfortunately, however, AFs are usually not fully extended because of their pre-mature breakage, which hampers their use to generate biocompatible suprastructures, although the amounts of AFs could be amplified via their self-propagation property. Here, we have demonstrated the full extension of AFs of alpha-synuclein (alphaS) by introducing a cysteine residue to its C-terminus which prevents the shear-induced fragmentation of AFs via site-directed disulfide bond formation on the exposed surface of AFs. These heat- and cold-resistant elongated AFs were entangled into self-healable hydrogels through a mild disulfide-exchange process in the presence of tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine, which subsequently developed into dye-absorbing aerogels upon freeze-drying without collapsing the three-dimensional internal fibrillar network. The resulting alphaS aerogel with high porosity and increased surface area was shown to be capable of absorbing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances. In addition, the aerogel was further engineered with 8-arm polyethylene glycol containing a sulfhydryl group to increase its drug loading capacity and protease susceptibility for drug unloading. The elongated AFs, therefore, have been suggested to play a pivotal component for the development of bio-nano-matrix for diverse biological applications including drug delivery, tissue engineering, and environmental remediation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Due to accurate protein self-assembly process, alpha-synuclein forms an amyloid fibril which are the major component of Lewy bodies. In general, alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils break under thermal fluctuations as these nanofibrils elongate to reach certain length. In this study, we have demonstrated the full extension of alpha-synuclein amyloid fibrils by introducing a cysteine residue to its C-terminus by forming site-directed disulfide bonds on the exposed surface of amyloid fibrils for the first time. The resulting elongated amyloid fibrils were mechanically robust and stable. By using elongated amyloid fibrils, we have made self-healable amyloid fibril hydrogel and dye-absorbing aerogel.",Acta biomaterialia,2022 Jun,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(22)00217-3,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35421616/,
35398268,Nano-hydroxyapatite-evoked immune response synchronized with controllable immune adjuvant release for strengthening melanoma-specific growth inhibition.,"Concerns about the potential systematic toxicity limit the extensive application of traditional therapeutic drugs for melanoma therapy, nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) with good biocompatibility and anti-tumor ability could be an alternative choice. In this study, nHA was employed as an anti-tumor biomaterial due to its tumor-specific toxicity. Meanwhile, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) served as the immune adjuvant to activate the immune response. The delivery platform was fabricated by co-encapsulation of both nHA and GM-CSF into a biocompatible thermosensitive PLGA-PEG-PLGA hydrogel. The results showed that the bio-activities of nHA and GM-CSF could be well-maintained within the hydrogel. Interestingly, the addition of nHA could attenuate the burst release of GM-CSF due to possible protein absorption capacity of nHA, which is beneficial for GM-CSF sustainable release at the tumor site, achieving boosted and prolonged anti-tumor immunity. The in vitro and in vivo data demonstrated that nHA/GM-CSF hydrogel exhibited greater potency to inhibit tumor growth via enhanced CD8(+) T-cell response compared with hydrogel and nHA hydrogel groups, contributed by the synergistic effects of nHA and GM-CSF. Overall, the strategy combining nHA and immune adjuvant shows great promise, which largely broadens the choice of combinational therapies for melanoma. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) has been confirmed to specifically inhibit melanoma tumor growth and induce immune response. However, its antitumor efficiency and immunity-evoking capacity are limited. In this study, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was introduced to serve as the immune adjuvant. Both of them were encapsulated into a biocompatible thermosensitive PLGA-PEG-PLGA hydrogel. The addition of nHA could attenuate the burst release of GM-CSF due to the interaction with nHA, which is beneficial for GM-CSF sustainable release at tumor site, achieving boosted and prolonged anti-tumor immunity. Anti-tumor immune response could be activated due to the release of tumor-associated antigen and tumor debris induced by the specifically tumor inhibition effect of nHA and GM-CSF.

However, due to the weak nature of physical crosslinking, PEC swelling and cargo burst release are easily initiated. Also, most current cell-laden PEC hydrogels are limited to fibers and microcapsules with unfavorable dimensions and structures for practical implantations. To overcome these drawbacks, alginate (Alg)/poly-L-ornithine (PLO) PEC hydrogels are fabricated into microcapsules, fibers, and bulk scaffolds to explore their feasibility as drug and cell carriers. Stable Alg/PLO microcapsules with controllable shapes are obtained through aqueous electrospraying technique, which avoids osmotic shock and prolongs the release time. Model enzyme and nanosized cargos are successfully encapsulated and continuously released for more than 21 days. Alg/PLO PEC fibers are then prepared to encapsulate brown adipose progenitors (BAPs) and Jurkat T cells. The electrostatic interactions between Alg and PLO are found to facilitate the printability and self-support ability of Alg/PLO bioinks. Alg/PLO PEC fibers and scaffolds support cell proliferation, differentiation, and functionalization. These results demonstrate new options for biocompatible PEC hydrogel preparation and improve the understanding of PEC hydrogels as drug and cell carriers. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, the concept of polyelectrolyte complex hydrogel networks as drug and cell carriers has been demonstrated. Their feasibility to achieve sustained drug release and cell functionality was explored, from microcapsules to fibers to three-dimension printed scaffolds. PEC microcapsules with controllable shapes were obtained. Therapeutic drugs can be encapsulated and continuously release for more than 21 days. Benefiting from the dynamic interactions of physically crosslinked PEC, self-healing fibers were achieved. Besides, the electrostatic interactions between polyelectrolytes were found to facilitate the printability and self-support ability of PEC bioinks. The PEC fibers and scaffolds with controllable structure supported cell proliferation, differentiation, and function. The outcome of current research promotes design of new biocompatible PEC hydrogels and potential drug and cell carriers.",Acta biomaterialia,2022 Jan 15,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(21)00745-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34774784/,
34644612,An interpenetrating and patternable conducting polymer hydrogel for electrically stimulated release of glutamate.,"Recent advances in drug delivery have made it possible to release bioactive agents from neural implants specifically to local tissues. Conducting polymer coatings have been explored as a delivery platform in bioelectronics, however, their utility is restricted by their limited loading capacity and stability. This study presents the fabrication of a stable conducting polymer hydrogel (CPH), comprising the hydrogel gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), and conducting polymer polypyrrole (PPy) for the electrically controlled delivery of glutamate (Glu). The hybrid GelMA/PPy/Glu can be photolithographically patterned and covalently bonded to an electrode. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis confirmed the interpenetrating nature of PPy through the GelMA hydrogels. Electrochemical polymerisation of PPy/Glu through the GelMA hydrogels resulted in a significant increase in the charge storage capacity as determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Long-term electrochemical and mechanical stability was demonstrated over 1000 CV cycles and extracts of the materials were cytocompatible with SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines. Release of Glu from the CPH was responsive to electrical stimulation with almost five times the amount of Glu released upon constant reduction (-0.6 V) compared to when no stimulus was applied. Notably, GelMA/PPy/Glu was able to deliver almost 14 times higher amounts of Glu compared to conventional PPy/Glu films. The described CPH coatings are well suited in implantable drug delivery applications and compared to conducting polymer films can deliver higher quantities of drug in response to mild electrical stimulus. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Conducting polymer hydrogels (CPH) have been explored for the electrically controlled release of bioactives from implantable devices. Typically, the conducting polymer component does not fully penetrate the hydrogel. We report, for the first time, a completely interpenetrating CPH allowing for the full benefits of the composite material to be realised, the hydrogels provide a reservoir for drug delivery, and conducting polymer renders the material responsive to electrical stimulation for drug release. We report a CPH for the electrically controlled delivery of glutamate (excitatory neurotransmitter) where several-fold more glutamate can be delivered compared to conducting polymer films. The described CPH coatings are well suited for use in bioelectronic devices to deliver large quantities of drug in response to mild electrical stimulus.",Acta biomaterialia,2022 Jan 1,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(21)00677-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34644612/,
34217903,Sodium alginate/collagen/stromal cell-derived factor-1 neural scaffold loaded with BMSCs promotes neurological function recovery after traumatic brain injury.,"Stem cell therapy is promising for neural repair in devastating traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the low survival and differentiation rates of transplanted stem cells are main obstacles to efficient stem cell therapy in TBI. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4 are key factors that regulate the survival, recruitment, and differentiation of stem cells. Herein, we synthesized a sodium alginate (SA)/collagen type I (Col)/SDF-1 hydrogel and investigated whether the SA/Col/SDF-1 hydrogel loaded with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) had therapeutic effects on a TBI model. Our results showed that the SA/Col/SDF-1 scaffold could stably release SDF-1 and provide biocompatible and biodegradable microenvironment for the survival, migration, and neuronal differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. In a rat model of TBI, the SA/Col/SDF-1 hydrogel loaded with BMSCs significantly ameliorated motor and cognition dysfunction and relieved anxiety and depressive-like behaviors. In addition, the BMSCs/SA/Col/SDF-1 scaffold reduced brain lesions and neuronal cell death and mitigated neuroinflammation. Further studies demonstrated that the BMSCs/SA/Col/SDF-1 hydrogel promoted the migration of BMSCs in the lesions and partly enhanced neurogenesis by activating the SDF-1/CXCR4-mediated FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway. Taken together, our results indicate that the SA/Col/SDF-1 scaffold loaded with BMSCs exerts neuroreparative effects in a TBI rat model, and thus, it may serve as an alternative neural regeneration scaffold for brain injury repair. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Hydrogel facilitates the biological behaviors of transplanted stem cells for tissue regeneration. In this study, we synthesized sodium alginate (SA)/collagen type I (Col)/ scaffold to simultaneously deliver stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in a rat model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We found that the SA/Col/SDF-1 hydrogel could continuously release SDF-1 and was conducive to the survival, migration and neuronal differentiation of BMSCs in vitro. In addition, the SA/Col/SDF-1 hydrogel loaded with BMSCs significantly ameliorated neurological deficits, mitigated neuroinflammation, promoted the recruitment of BMSCs and enhanced neurogenesis in TBI partly by activating the SDF-1/CXCR4-mediated FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway.

33713861,A 3-D human model of complex cardiac arrhythmias.,"Cardiac arrhythmias impact over 12 million people globally, with an increasing incidence of acquired arrhythmias. Although animal models have shed light onto fundamental arrhythmic mechanisms, species-specific differences and ethical concerns remain. Current human models using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) either lack the higher order tissue organization of the heart or implement unreliable arrhythmia induction techniques. Our goal was to develop a robust model of acquired arrhythmia by disrupting cardiomyocyte cell-cell signaling - one of the hallmarks of complex arrhythmias. Human 3D microtissues were generated by seeding hydrogel-embedded hiPSC-CMs and cardiac fibroblasts into an established microwell system designed to enable active and passive force assessment. Cell-cell signaling was disrupted using methyl-beta cyclodextrin (MBCD), previously shown to disassemble cardiac gap junctions. We demonstrate that arrhythmias were progressive and present in all microtissues within 5 days of treatment. Arrhythmic tissues exhibited reduced conduction velocity, an increased number of distinct action potentials, and reduced action potential cycle length. Arrhythmic tissues also showed significant reduction in contractile force generation, increased beating frequency, and increased passive tension and collagen deposition, in line with fibrosis. A subset of tissues with more complex arrhythmias exhibited 3D spatial differences in action potential propagation. Pharmacological and electrical defibrillation was successful. Transcriptomic data indicated an enrichment of genes consistent with cardiac arrhythmias. MBCD removal reversed the arrhythmic phenotype, resulting in synchronicity despite not resolving fibrosis. This innovative & reliable human-relevant 3D acquired arrhythmia model shows potential for improving our understanding of arrhythmic action potential conduction and furthering therapeutic development. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This work describes a 3D human model of cardiac arrhythmia-on-a-chip with high reproducibility, fidelity, and extensive functional applicability. To mimic in vivo conditions, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and cardiac fibroblasts from healthy controls were combined in a biocompatible fibrin hydrogel and seeded between two deflectable polymeric rods. Using the innate functional properties of this 3D model as well as advanced optical imaging techniques we demonstrated dramatic changes in contraction rate, synchronicity, and electrophysiological conduction in arrhythmic tissues relative to controls. Taken together, these data demonstrate the distinctive potential of this new model for pathophysiological studies, and for arrhythmia drug testing applications.",Acta biomaterialia,2021 Sep 15,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(21)00145-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33713861/,

30550934,Self-assembled GFFYK peptide hydrogel enhances the therapeutic efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model.,"Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has emerged as a very promising strategy for the treatments of peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, MSC-based therapies are limited by low cell retention and survival rate in the ischemic zone. Small molecular (SM) hydrogels have shown attractive abilities to enhance the therapeutic effects of human MSCs via promoting their proliferation or maintaining their differentiation potential. Here, we designed and synthesized a new bioactive and biocompatible hydrogel, Nap-GFFYK-Thiol, using disulfide bonds as cleavable linkers to control the molecular self-assembly and we hypothesized this hydrogel could enhance the retention and engraftment of human placenta-derived MSCs (hP-MSCs) in a mouse ischemic hindlimb model. In vitro results demonstrated that the Nap-GFFYK-Thiol hydrogel increased cell viability through paracrine effects. Moreover, it enhanced the proangiogenic and anti-apoptotic effects of hP-MSCs. In vivo, Nap-GFFYK-Thiol hydrogel improved the hP-MSC retention in the murine ischemic hindlimb model as visualized by bioluminescence imaging. Furthermore, cotransplantation of hP-MSCs with hydrogel improved blood perfusion, leading to superior limb salvage. These therapeutic effects may attribute to reduced inflammatory cell infiltration, enhanced angiogenesis as well as suppressed collagen deposition. In conclusion, the Nap-GFFYK-Thiol hydrogel fabricated using disulfide bonds as cleavable linkers serves as an artificial niche for promoting hP-MSC survival and proangiogenic factor secretion in PAD therapy and thereby provide an alternative strategy for PAD therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Although several phase I/II clinical trials of MSC-based treatments for critical limb ischemia (CLI) are ongoing, MSC-based therapies are still challenged by the low quality and quantity of cells in the ischemic zone, especially in cases of extensive or irreversible damage. Hydrogels have favorable biocompatibility and safety records in the medical field. In the current study, we engineered a new bioactive and biocompatible hydrogel, Nap-GFFYK-Thiol, using disulfide bonds as cleavable linkers to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of human placenta-derived MSCs (hP-MSCs) in mouse limb ischemia model. Notably, Nap-GFFYK-Thiol hydrogel acts as an artificial niche for promoting hP-MSC survival and proangiogenic factor secretion in PAD therapy, which further promoted the restoration of blood perfusion and regeneration of muscle cells.

30476581,Porous scaffolds from droplet microfluidics for prevention of intrauterine adhesion.,"Severe intrauterine adhesions (IUAs) have a great negative impact on women's psychological and reproductive health. It remains a significant challenge to prevent postoperative IUAs because of the complications of various clinical preventive measures and incompatibility of uterine cavity morphology. Herein, we present a new drug-loadedporous scaffold based on a microfluidic droplet template, which combines the characteristics of the artificial biocompatible material GelMA and the natural polysaccharide material Na-alginate. By changing the containers that collect the microfluidic droplets, the porous scaffold conforming to the shape of the uterine cavity could be obtained. The porous structure, mechanical property, and flexibility impart the scaffold with compressibility and send it to the uterus through the vagina. In addition, the external-internal connected open structures could load and control the release of drugs to repair the damaged region continuously in vivo. To verify the antiadhesion and repair of drug-loaded porous scaffolds, we tested the system in the rat model of IUAs, and it was demonstrated that the system had the ability to improve neovascularization, cellularize the damaged tissue, and repair the endometrium. These features provide the drug-loaded porous scaffolds with new options for the improvement of postoperative IUAs. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Intrauterine adhesions are caused by various causes of damage to the endometrial basal layer, thus leading to part or entire adhesions in the cervical or uterine cavity. Clinically, various preventive measures reach the barrier effect through the physical barrier, which are difficult to further promote the repair of the damaged endometrium, and most of them have apparent side effects. This study aims to prepare compressible and biodegradable three-dimensional porous drug-loading biological scaffolds. GelMA and Na-alginate have desirable biocompatibility. The interconnect porous scaffolds, which were prepared through the combination of biomaterials and single emulsion microfluidics, not only have compressibility but also provide space for drug delivery and release. This system can further promote the repair of the endometrium while preventing adhesion.",Acta biomaterialia,2019 Jan 15,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(18)30670-6,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30476581/,
30414483,Biomaterials and glia: Progress on designs to modulate neuroinflammation.,"Microglia are multi-functional cells that play a vital role in establishing and maintaining the function of the nervous system and determining the fate of neurons following injury or neuropathology. The roles of microglia are diverse and essential to the capacity of the nervous system to recover from injury, however sustained inflammation can limit recovery and drive chronic disease processes such as neurodegenerative disorders. When assessing implantable therapeutic devices in the central nervous system, an improved lifetime of the implant is considered achievable through the attenuation of microglial inflammation. Consequently, there is a tremendous underexplored potential in biomaterial and engineered design to modulate neuroinflammation for therapeutic benefit. Several strategies for improving device compatibility reviewed here include: biocompatible coatings, improved designs in finer and flexible shapes to reduce tissue shear-related scarring, and loading of anti-inflammatory drugs. Studies about microglial cell cultures in 3D hydrogels and nanoscaffolds to assess various injuries and disorders are also discussed. A variety of other microglia-targeting treatments are also reviewed, including nanoparticulate systems, cellular backpacks, and gold plinths, with the intention of delivering anti-inflammatory drugs by targeting the phagocytic nature of microglia. Overall, this review highlights recent advances in biomaterials targeting microglia and inflammatory function with the potential for improving implant rejection and biocompatibility studies.

30366132,Gallol-derived ECM-mimetic adhesive bioinks exhibiting temporal shear-thinning and stabilization behavior.,"3D bioprinting is an attractive technique to fabricate well-organized, cell-laden constructs for tissue repair and disease modeling. Although numerous hydrogel bioinks have been developed, materials are still needed that mimic the cellular microenvironment, have the appropriate viscosity and stabilization for printing, and are cytocompatible. Here, we present a unique gallol-modified extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogel ink that is inspired by rapid fruit browning phenomena. The gallol-modification of ECM components (e.g., hyaluronic acid, gelatin) allowed (i) immediate gelation and shear-thinning properties by dynamic hydrogen bonds on short time-scales and (ii) further auto-oxidation and covalent crosslinking for stabilization on longer time-scales. The gallol ECM hydrogel ink was printable using an extrusion-based 3D printer by exploiting temporal shear-thinning properties, and further showed cytocompatibility ( approximately 95% viability) and on-tissue printability due to adhesiveness of gallol moieties. Printed cell-laden filaments degraded and swelled with culture over 6 days, corresponding to increases in cell density and spreading. Ultimately, this strategy is useful for designing hydrogel inks with tunable properties for 3D bioprinting. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: 3D bioprinting is a promising technique for the fabrication of cell-laden constructs for applications as in vitro models or for therapeutic applications. Despite the previous development of numerous hydrogel bioinks, there still remain challenging considerations in the design of bioinks. In this study, we present a unique cytocompatible hydrogel ink with gallol modification that is inspired by rapid fruit browning phenomena. The gallol hydrogel ink has three important properties: i) it shows immediate gelation by dynamic, reversible bonds for shear-thinning extrusion, ii) it allows spontaneous stabilization by subsequent covalent crosslinking after printing, and iii) it is printable on tissues by adhesive properties of gallol moieties. As such, this work presents a new approach in the design of hydrogel inks.",Acta biomaterialia,2019 Sep 1,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",S1742-7061(18)30627-5,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30366132/,
29398644,Microgels produced using microfluidic on-chip polymer blending for controlled released of VEGF encoding lentivectors.,"Alginate hydrogels are widely used as delivery vehicles due to their ability to encapsulate and release a wide range of cargos in a gentle and biocompatible manner. The release of encapsulated therapeutic cargos can be promoted or stunted by adjusting the hydrogel physiochemical properties. However, the release from such systems is often skewed towards burst-release or lengthy retention. To address this, we hypothesized that the overall magnitude of burst release could be adjusted by combining microgels with distinct properties and release behavior. Microgel suspensions were generated using a process we have termed on-chip polymer blending to yield composite suspensions of a range of microgel formulations. In this manner, we studied how alginate percentage and degradation relate to the release of lentivectors. Whereas changes in alginate percentage had a minimal impact on lentivector release, microgel degradation led to a 3-fold increase, and near complete release, over 10 days. Furthermore, by controlling the amount of degradable alginate present within microgels the relative rate of release can be adjusted. A degradable formulation of microgels was used to deliver vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-encoding lentivectors in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay and yielded a proangiogenic response in comparison to the same lentivectors delivered in suspension. The utility of blended microgel suspensions may provide an especially appealing platform for the delivery of lentivectors or similarly sized therapeutics. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Genetic therapeutics hold considerable potential for the treatment of diseases and disorders including ischemic cardiovascular diseases. To realize this potential, genetic vectors must be precisely and efficiently delivered to targeted regions of the body. However, conventional methods of delivery do not provide sufficient spatial and temporal control. Here, we demonstrate how alginate microgels provide a basis for developing systems for controlled genetic vector release. We adjust the physiochemical properties of alginate for quicker or slower release, and we demonstrate how combining distinct formulations of microgels can tune the release of the overall composite microgel suspension. These composite suspensions are generated using a straightforward and powerful application of droplet microfluidics which allows for the real-time generation of a composite suspension.",Acta biomaterialia,2018 Mar 15,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(18)30024-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29398644/,
29281806,Stem cell-inspired secretome-rich injectable hydrogel to repair injured cardiac tissue.,"The objective of this study was to develop an injectable and biocompatible hydrogel that can deliver a cocktail of therapeutic biomolecules (secretome) secreted by human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) to the peri-infarct myocardium. Gelatin and Laponite(R) were combined to formulate a shear-thinning, nanocomposite hydrogel (nSi Gel) as an injectable carrier of secretome (nSi Gel+). The growth factor composition and the pro-angiogenic activity of the secretome were tested in vitro by evaluating the proliferation, migration and tube formation of human umbilical endothelial cells. The therapeutic efficacy of the nSi Gel + system was then investigated in vivo in rats by intramyocardial injection into the peri-infarct region. Subsequently, the inflammatory response, angiogenesis, scar formation, and heart function were assessed. Biocompatibility of the developed nSi Gel was confirmed by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical tests which showed no significant differences in the level of inflammatory genes, microRNAs, and cell marker expression compared to the untreated control group. In addition, the only group that showed a significant increase in capillary density, reduction in scar area and improved cardiac function was treated with the nSi Gel+. Our in vitro and in vivo findings demonstrate the potential of this new secretome-loaded hydrogel as an alternative strategy to treat myocardial infarction. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Stem cell based-therapies represent a possible solution to repair damaged myocardial tissue by promoting cardioprotection, angiogenesis, and reduced fibrosis. However, recent evidence indicates that most of the positive outcomes are likely due to the release of paracrine factors (cytokines, growth factors, and exosomes) from the cells and not because of the local engraftment of stem cells. This cocktail of essential growth factors and paracrine signals is known as secretome can be isolated in vitro, and the biomolecule composition can be controlled by varying stem-cell culture conditions. Here, we propose a straightforward strategy to deliver secretome produced from hASCs by using a nanocomposite injectable hydrogel made of gelatin and Laponite(R). The designed secretome-loaded hydrogel represents a promising alternative to traditional stem cell therapy for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.",Acta biomaterialia,2018 Mar 15,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(17)30791-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29281806/,
28532899,"Nanodiamond-based injectable hydrogel for sustained growth factor release: Preparation, characterization and in vitro analysis.","Nanodiamonds (NDs) represent an emerging class of carbon nanomaterials that possess favorable physical and chemical properties to be used as multifunctional carriers for a variety of bioactive molecules. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of a new injectable ND-based nanocomposite hydrogel which facilitates a controlled release of therapeutic molecules for regenerative applications. In particular, we have formulated a thermosensitive hydrogel using gelatin, chitosan and NDs that provides a sustained release of exogenous human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for wound healing applications. Addition of NDs improved the mechanical properties of the injectable hydrogels without affecting its thermosensitive gelation properties. Biocompatibility of the generated hydrogel was verified by in vitro assessment of apoptotic gene expressions and anti-inflammatory interleukin productions. NDs were complexed with VEGF and the inclusion of this complex in the hydrogel network enabled the sustained release of the angiogenic growth factor. These results suggest for the first time that NDs can be used to formulate a biocompatible, thermosensitive and multifunctional hydrogel platform that can function both as a filling agent to modulate hydrogel properties, as well as a delivery platform for the controlled release of bioactive molecules and growth factors. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: One of the major drawbacks associated with the use of conventional hydrogels as carriers of growth factors is their inability to control the release kinetics of the loaded molecules. In fact, in most cases, a burst release is inevitable leading to diminished therapeutic effects and unsuccessful therapies. As a potential solution to this issue, we hereby propose a strategy of incorporating ND complexes within an injectable hydrogel matrix. The functional groups on the surface of the NDs can establish interactions with the model growth factor VEGF and promote a prolonged release from the polymer network, therefore, providing a longer therapeutic effect. Our strategy demonstrates the efficacy of using NDs as an essential component for the design of a novel injectable nanocomposite system with improved release capabilities.",Acta biomaterialia,2017 Aug,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",S1742-7061(17)30307-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28532899/,
28501713,An in situ photocrosslinkable platelet rich plasma - Complexed hydrogel glue with growth factor controlled release ability to promote cartilage defect repair.,"The repair of articular cartilage injury is a great clinical challenge. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has attracted much attention for the repair of articular cartilage injury, because it contains various growth factors that are beneficial for wound repair. However, current administration methods of PRP have many shortcomings, such as unstable biological fixation and burst release of growth factors, all of which complicate its application in the repair of articular cartilage and compromise its therapeutic efficacy. In this study, based on our previously reported photoinduced imine crosslinking (PIC) reaction, we developed an in situ photocrosslinkable PRP hydrogel glue (HNPRP) through adding a photoresponsive hyaluronic acid (HA-NB) which could generate aldehyde groups upon light irradiation and subsequently react with amino groups, into autologous PRP. Our study showed that HNPRP hydrogel glue was cytocompatible and could be conveniently and rapidly prepared in situ, forming a robust hydrogel scaffold. In addition, our results demonstrated that HNPRP hydrogel not only achieved controlled release of growth factors, but also showed strong tissue adhesive ability. Therefore, HNPRP hydrogel was quite suitable for cartilage defect regeneration. Our further in vitro experiment showed that HNPRP hydrogel could promote the proliferation and migration of chondrocytes and bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs). In vivo testing using a rabbit full-thickness cartilage defect model demonstrated that HNPRP hydrogel could achieve integrative hyaline cartilage regeneration and its therapeutic efficacy was better than thrombin activated PRP gel. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we have developed a photocrosslinkable platelet rich plasma (PRP) - complexed hydrogel glue (HNPRP) for cartilage regeneration. The in situ formed HNPRP hydrogel glue showed not only the controlled release ability of growth factors, but also strong tissue adhesiveness, which could resolve the current problems in clinical application of PRP. Furthermore, HNPRP hydrogel glue could promote integrative hyaline cartilage regeneration, and its reparative efficacy for cartilage defect was better than thrombin activated PRP gel.

28069504,pH-sensitive peptide hydrogel for glucose-responsive insulin delivery.,"Glucose-responsive system is one of important options for self-regulated insulin delivery to treat diabetes, which has become an issue of great public health concern in the world. In this study, we developed a novel and biocompatible glucose-responsive insulin delivery system using a pH-sensitive peptide hydrogel as a carrier loaded with glucose oxidase, catalase and insulin. The peptide could self-assemble into hydrogel under physiological conditions. When hypoglycemia is encountered, neighboring alkaline amino acid side chains are significantly repulsed due to reduced local pH by the enzymatic conversion of glucose into gluconic acid. This is followed by unfolding of individual hairpins, disassembly and release of insulin. The glucose-responsive hydrogel system was characterized on the basis of structure, conformation, rheology, morphology, acid-sensitivity and the amount of consistent release of insulin in vitro and vivo. The results illustrated that our system can not only regulate the blood glucose levels in vitro but also in mice models having STZ-induced diabetes.

27403884,"Compositional tuning of epoxide-polyetheramine ""click"" reaction toward cytocompatible, cationic hydrogel particles with antimicrobial and DNA binding activities.","The ""click"" characteristics of nucleophilic opening of epoxide have recently been exploited for the development of a functional hydrogel particle system based on commercially available bisepoxide and triamine polyetheramine monomers. Key features of these particles include high cationic charges and responsiveness to temperature, pH, and oxidation. Despite these advantages, the cytocompatibility of these particles must be considered prior to use in biomedical applications. Here we demonstrate that, by introducing a diamine polyetheramine as a comonomer in the ""click"" reaction, and tuning its molar ratio with the triamine monomer, cationic nanoparticles with improved cytocompatibility can be prepared. The reduced cytotoxicity is primarily due to the hydrophilic backbone of the diamine comonomer, which has polyethylene glycol as a primary component. The resulting nanoparticles formed from the diamine comonomer exhibited a lower surface charge, while maintaining a comparable size. In addition, the responsiveness of the nanoparticles to temperature, pH, and oxidation was conserved, while achieving greater colloidal stability at basic pH. Results from this study further demonstrated that the nanoparticles were able to encapsulate Nile red, a model for hydrophobic drug molecules, were effective against the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, and were capable of binding DNA through ionic complexation. Based on the results from this work, the use of diamine comonomers significantly reduces the cytotoxicity of similarly developed hydrogel nanoparticles, allowing for numerous biomedical applications, including nanocarriers for therapeutic agents with poor water solubility, treatment of bacterial infection, and non-viral vectors for gene therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In recent years significant attention has been placed on the development of nanocarriers for numerous biomedical applications. Of particular interest are cationic polymers, which contain high positive surface charges that allow binding of numerous therapeutic agents. Unfortunately, the advantages of cationic polymers for binding, are often negated by the tendency of these polymers to be cytotoxic. Previous studies have developed highly responsive cationic hydrogel nanoparticles, which meet several of the criteria for biomedical applications, but were acutely cytotoxic. In this work, cationic hydrogel nanoparticles, with significantly improved cytocompatibility, were synthesized using simple, green epoxy chemistry. In addition, the ability of these nanoparticles to maintain a small size (<500nm), bind DNA, encapsulate hydrophobic drugs, and kill bacteria was maintained.",Acta biomaterialia,2016 Oct 1,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",S1742-7061(16)30327-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27403884/,
27142255,Protein diffusion characteristics in the hydrogels of poly(ethylene glycol) and zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (pSBMA).,"Nonfouling materials such as neutral poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (pSBMA) are ideal biocompatible materials for drug, especially protein drug delivery. The interaction behavior of protein between the nonfouling materials could cause great impact on their future applications, such as controlled release drug delivery systems. In this work, we investigated the diffusion behavior of the fluorescence-labeled model proteins (bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme (LYZ)) in nonfouling PEG, pSBMA and mixed PEG-SBMA hydrogels (SBMA:PEG 4:1, SBMA:PEG 1:4). It was observed that these four hydrogels showed varied diffusion behavior for either negatively charged BSA or positively charged LYZ due to protein-polymer interaction and the free water content in hydrogel matrix. The relatively stronger interaction between protein-PEG than protein-pSBMA could increase protein loading efficiency and control release rate by changing ratio of PEG to SBMA in the hybrid hydrogel. Moreover, it is further demonstrated the free water (freezable water) content in low cross-linked hydrogel, not the equilibrium water content (EWC), is a more accurate parameter to reflect the diffusion behavior of protein molecules. Thus, these results together provide new insights of the interactions between protein molecules and nonfouling polymers as well as the bio applications of the nonfouling polymeric hydrogels. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This work shows that the relative stronger interaction between protein-PEG than protein-pSBMA could increase protein loading efficiency and control release rate by the change ratio of PEG to SBMA in the hydrogel, while the free water (freezable water) content in low cross-linked hydrogel, not the equilibrium water content (EWC), is a more accurate parameter to reflect the diffusion behavior of protein molecules. The impact of this work (i) gains some new insights of the interactions between protein molecules and nonfouling polymer matrixes for protein drug delivery; (ii) prompts to apply the weak PEG-protein interactions to protein drug loading and release; (iii) provides a new fundamental understanding of free water in hydrogel for protein diffusion.",Acta biomaterialia,2016 Aug,Journal Article,S1742-7061(16)30207-0,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27142255/,
26022968,A novel injectable thermoresponsive and cytocompatible gel of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) with layered double hydroxides facilitates siRNA delivery into chondrocytes in 3D culture.,"Hybrid hydrogels composed of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAM) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are presented in this study as novel injectable and thermoresponsive materials for siRNA delivery, which could specifically target several negative regulators of tissue homeostasis in cartilaginous tissues. Effectiveness of siRNA transfection using pNIPAAM formulated with either MgAl-LDH or MgFe-LDH platelets was investigated using osteoarthritic chondrocytes. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an endogenous model gene to evaluate the extent of silencing. No significant adverse effects of pNIPAAM/LDH hydrogels on cell viability were noticed. Cellular uptake of fluorescently labeled siRNA was greatly enhanced (>75%) in pNIPAAM/LDH hydrogel constructs compared to alginate, hyaluronan and fibrin gels, and was absent in pNIPAAM hydrogel without LDH platelets. When using siRNA against GAPDH, 82-98% reduction of gene expression was found in both types of pNIPAAM/LDH hydrogel constructs after 6 days of culturing. In the pNIPAAM/MgAl-LDH hybrid hydrogel, 80-95% of GAPDH enzyme activity was reduced in parallel with gene. Our findings show that the combination of a cytocompatible hydrogel and therapeutic RNA oligonucleotides is feasible. Thus it might hold promise in treating degeneration of cartilaginous tissues by providing supporting scaffolds for cells and interference with locally produced degenerative factors.",Acta biomaterialia,2015 Sep,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(15)00242-1,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26022968/,
25818947,Covalently-crosslinked mucin biopolymer hydrogels for sustained drug delivery.,"The sustained delivery of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs from hydrogels has remained a challenge requiring the design and scalable production of complex multifunctional synthetic polymers. Here, we demonstrate that mucin glycoproteins, the gel-forming constituents of native mucus, are suitable for assembly into robust hydrogels capable of facilitating the sustained release of hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs. Covalently-crosslinked mucin hydrogels were generated via exposure of methacrylated mucin to ultraviolet light in the presence of a free radical photoinitiator. The hydrogels exhibited an elastic modulus similar to that of soft mammalian tissue and were sensitive to proteolytic degradation by pronase. Paclitaxel, a hydrophobic anti-cancer drug, and polymyxin B, a positively-charged hydrophilic antibacterial drug, were retained in the hydrogels and released linearly with time over seven days. After four weeks of drug release, the hydrogels continued to release sufficient amounts of active paclitaxel to reduce HeLa cell viability and sufficient amounts of active polymyxin B to prevent bacterial proliferation. Along with previously-established anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and hydrocarbon-solubilizing properties of mucin, the results of this study establish mucin as a readily-available, chemically-versatile, naturally-biocompatible alternative to complex multifunctional synthetic polymers as building blocks in the design of biomaterials for sustained drug delivery.",Acta biomaterialia,2015 Jul,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(15)00134-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25818947/,
25712390,Effective and durable genetic modification of human mesenchymal stem cells via controlled release of rAAV vectors from self-assembling peptide hydrogels with a maintained differentiation potency.,"Controlling the release of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors from biocompatible materials is a novel, attractive approach to increase the residence time and effectiveness of a gene carrier at a defined target site. Self-assembling peptides have an ability to form stable hydrogels and encapsulate cells upon exposure to physiological pH and ionic strength. Here, we examined the capacity of the peptide hydrogel RAD16-I in a pure (RAD) form or combined with hyaluronic acid (RAD-HA) to release rAAV vectors as a means to genetically modify primary human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), a potent source of cells for regenerative medicine. Specifically, we demonstrate the ability of the systems to efficiently encapsulate and release rAAV vectors in a sustained, controlled manner for the effective transduction of hMSCs (up to 80%) without deleterious effects on cell viability (up to 100%) or on their potential for chondrogenic differentiation over time (up to 21days). The present study demonstrates that RAD16-I is an advantageous material with tunable properties to control the release of rAAV vectors as a promising tool to develop new, improved therapeutic approaches for tissue engineering in vivo.",Acta biomaterialia,2015 May,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",S1742-7061(15)00076-8,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25712390/,
24954908,CO2-assisted synthesis of silk fibroin hydrogels and aerogels.,"Biocompatible and biodegradable porous materials based on silk fibroin (SF), a natural protein derived from the Bombyx mori silkworm, are being extensively investigated for use in biomedical applications including mammalian cell bioprocessing, tissue engineering and drug delivery applications. In this work, low-pressure, gaseous CO2 is used as an acidifying agent to fabricate SF hydrogels. This low-pressure CO2 acidification method is compared to an acidification method using high-pressure CO2 to demonstrate the effect of CO2 mass transfer and pressure on SF sol-gel kinetics. The effect of SF molecular weight on the sol-gel kinetics is determined using the low-pressure CO2 method. The results from these studies demonstrate that low-pressure CO2 processing proves to be a facile method for synthesizing 3-D SF hydrogels.",Acta biomaterialia,2014 Oct,"Journal Article; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",S1742-7061(14)00254-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24954908/,
24035886,Single and dual crosslinked oxidized methacrylated alginate/PEG hydrogels for bioadhesive applications.,"A degradable, cytocompatible bioadhesive can facilitate surgical procedures and minimize patient pain and post-surgical complications. In this study a bioadhesive hydrogel system based on oxidized methacrylated alginate/8-arm poly(ethylene glycol) amine (OMA/PEG) has been developed, and the bioadhesive characteristics of the crosslinked OMA/PEG hydrogels evaluated. Here we demonstrate that the swelling behavior, degradation profiles, and storage moduli of crosslinked OMA/PEG hydrogels are tunable by varying the degree of alginate oxidation. The crosslinked OMA/PEG hydrogels exhibit cytocompatibility when cultured with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, the adhesion strength of these hydrogels, controllable by varying the alginate oxidation level and measured using a porcine skin model, is superior to commercially available fibrin glue. This OMA/PEG hydrogel system with controllable biodegradation and mechanical properties and adhesion strength may be a promising bioadhesive for clinical use in biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, wound closure and healing, biomedical device implantation, and tissue engineering.",Acta biomaterialia,2014 Jan,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",S1742-7061(13)00452-2,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24035886/,
