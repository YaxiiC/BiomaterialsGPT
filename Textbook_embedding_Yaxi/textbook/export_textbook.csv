Given the fact that most bulk materials only provide mechanical stability for the implant and may not interact with tissues and fluids in vivo, surface modification and engineering of biomaterials plays a significant role towards addressing major clinical unmet challenges. Increasing data showed that altering surface properties including physiochemical, topographical, and mechanical characteristics, is a promising approach to tackle these problems. Surface engineering of biomaterials could influence the subsequent tissue and cellular events such as protein adsorption, cellular recolonization, adhesion, proliferation, migration, and the inflammatory response. Moreover, it could be based on mimicking the complex cell structure and environment or hierarchical nature of the bone. In this case, the design of nano/micrometer patterns and morphologies with control over their properties has been receiving the attention of biomaterial scientists due to the promising results for the relevant biomedical applications. This Special Issue presents original research papers that report on the current state-of-the-art in surface engineering of biomaterials, particularly implants and biomedical devices.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-05-01T15:35:00Z (GMT).

The generation of engineered tissues and organs (e. g. skin and bladder) has entered into the clinical practice in response to the chronic lack of organ donors. In particular, for the skeletal and cardiac muscles the translational potential of tissue engineering approaches has clearly been shown, even though the construction of this tissue lags behind others given the hierarchical, highly organized architecture of striated muscles. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the developed world, where the yearly incidence of Acute MI (AMI) is approx 2 million cases in Europe. Recovery from AMI and reperfusion is still less than ideal. Stem cell therapy may represent a valid treatment. However, delivery of stem cells alone to infarcted myocardium provides no structural support while the myocardium heals, and the injected stem cells do not properly integrate into the myocardium because they are not subjected to the mechanical forces that are known to drive myocardial cellular physiology. On the other hand, there are many clinical cases where the loss of skeletal muscle due to a traumatic injury, an aggressive tumour or prolonged denervation may be cured by the regeneration of this tissue. In vivo, stem or progenitor cells are sheltered in a specialized microenvironment (niche), which regulates their survival, proliferation and differentiation. The goal of this research topic is to highlight the available knowledge on biomaterials and bioactive molecules or a combination of them, which can be used successfully to differentiate stem or progenitor cells into beating cardiomyocytes or organized skeletal muscle in vivo. Innovations compared to the on-going trials may be: 1) the successful delivery of stem cells using sutural scaffolds instead of intracoronary or intramuscular injections; 2) protocols to use a limited number of autologous or allogeneic stem cells; 3) methods to drive their differentiation by modifying the chemical-physical properties of scaffolds or biomaterials, incorporating small molecules (i.e. miRNA) or growth factors; 4) methods to tailor the scaffolds to the elastic properties of the muscle; 5) studies which suggest how to realize scaffolds that optimize tissue functional integration, through the combination of the most up-to-date manufacturing technologies and use of bio-polymers with customized degradation properties.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-02-11T09:10:25Z (GMT).

Contributions reflect the fundamental studies, with a particular attention to the physico-chemical mechanical characterization of biomaterials, along with biocompatibility studies and potential clinical use. After an introductory chapter on the question of storage stability for biomaterial-based devices and products and for polymeric nanomedicines, a first review deals with the use and commercial sources of hydroxyapatite in tissue engineering and other biomedical applications. A study follows on optical fiber laser marking on the properties of stainless steel in implant manufacturing. Two other reviews, respectively, focused on the approaches to prevent or treat the effects of calcification that occurs in vivo on biomaterial-based implants and on the encapsulation of pancreatic islet cells for the treatment of type I diabetes will be presented. Finally, an overview on the physical bases and application in biomaterial science of the spray-drying process will close the volume. This setting will allow to achieve a general view of how classical and novel biomaterials can be applied, along with the methodologies necessary to design, develop, and characterize them, without the restrictions necessarily imposed by industrial or profit concerns. Readers will be apprised about the methodologies used to develop biomaterials possessing the physical and biological properties needed for specific medical and clinical applications.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-12-01T17:43:15Z (GMT).

The fundamental concept of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine is appealing to scientists, physicians, and lay people alike: to heal tissue or organ defects that the current medical practice deems difficult or impossible to cure. Tissue engineering combines cells, engineering, and materials methods with suitable biochemical and physiochemical factors to improve or replace biologic functions. Regenerative medicine is a new branch of medicine that attempts to change the course of chronic disease, in many instances regenerating failing organ systems lost due to age, disease, damage, or congenital defects. The area is rapidly becoming one of the most promising treatment options for patients suffering from tissue failure. This book of Regenerative Medicine and Tissue Engineering fairly reflects the state of the art of these two disciplines at this time as well as their therapeutic application. It covers numerous topics, such as stem cells, cell culture, polymer synthesis, novel biomaterials, drug delivery, therapeutics, and the creation of tissues and organs. The goal is to have this book serve as a reference for graduate students, post-docs, teachers, scientists and physicians, and as an explanatory analysis for executives in biotech and pharmaceutical companies.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-12-01T15:05:25Z (GMT).

Among the clinical applications of Tissue Engineering are the production of artificial skin for burn patients, tissue engineered trachea, cartilage for knee-replacement procedures, urinary bladder replacement, urethra substitutes and cellular therapies for the treatment of urinary incontinence. The Tissue Engineering approach has major advantages over traditional organ transplantation and circumvents the problem of organ shortage. Tissues reconstructed from readily available biopsy material induce only minimal or no immunogenicity when reimplanted in the patient. This book is aimed at anyone interested in the application of Tissue Engineering in different organ systems. It offers insights into a wide variety of strategies applying the principles of Tissue Engineering to tissue and organ regeneration.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-12-01T14:43:16Z (GMT).

Boccaccini,,,,2021-02-11T16:18:18Z,2021-02-11T16:18:18Z,2016,07/04/2016 11:22,,,"The intention of the editors A. R. Boccaccini and W. Höland has been to target this e-book to a broad readership and at the same time to present scientific contributions sufficiently detailed which discuss various specific fundamental aspects of inorganic biomaterials and their biomedical and dental applications. In this context, two large categories of biomaterials need to be mentioned, namely bioactive biomaterials for the replacement and regeneration of hard tissue and biocompatible, non-bioactive biomaterials for restorative dentistry. Both categories include products based on glasses or glass-ceramics as well as organic-inorganic composite materials. Among the bioactive products, BIOGLASS®, developed in the late 1960s by Prof. Dr. L. L. Hench, occupies a prominent position, being BIOGLASS® the first man-made material shown to form strong and functional bonding to leaving tissue. Sadly, Prof. Hench passed away in December 2015, at the time this e-book was being completed, it is therefore a great honor for the editors to dedicate this e-book to his memory. Indeed the book contains a comprehensive review written by Prof. Hench, in collaboration with Prof. J. R. Jones (UK), which provides a timely overview of the development and applications of bioactive glasses, including a discussion on the remaining challenges in the field. Further bioactive materials have been developed over the years by leading scientists such as Prof. Kokubo (Japan). These materials have also found their way into this book. The other contributions in this book, written by worldwide recognized experts in the field, present the latest advances in relevant areas such as scaffolds for bone tissue engineering, metallic ion releasing systems, cements, bioactive glass–polymer coatings, composites for bone regeneration, and effect of porosity on cellular response to bioceramics. In addition to bioactive materials, inorganic systems for restorative dentistry are also discussed in this e-book. Biomaterials for dental restorations consist of glassy or crystalline phases. Glass-ceramics represent a special group of inorganic biomaterials for dental restorations. Glass-ceramics are composed of at least one inorganic glassy phase and at least one crystalline phase. These products demonstrate a combination of properties, which include excellent aesthetics and the ability to mimic the optical properties of natural teeth, as well as high strength and toughness. They can be processed using special processing procedures, e.g. machining, moulding and sintering, to fabricate high quality products. The editors would like to extend their gratitude to the Frontiers team in Lausanne, Switzerland, for their outstanding dedication to make possible the publication of this e-book in a timely manner. It is our wish that the book will contribute to expand the field of inorganic biomaterials, both in terms of fundamental knowledge and applications, and that the book will be useful not only to established researchers but also to the increasing number of young scientists starting their careers in the field of inorganic biomaterials.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-02-11T16:18:18Z (GMT).

There is a growing interest in applying 3D printing technologies in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The main printing methods include extrusion-based, vat photopolymerization, droplet-based, and powder-based printing. A variety of materials have been used for printing, from metal alloys and ceramics to polymers and elastomers as well as from hydrogels to extracellular matrix proteins. More recently, bioprinting, a subcategory of 3D printing, has enabled the precise assembly of cell-laden biomaterials (i.e., bioinks) for the construction of complex 3D functional living tissues or artificial organs. In this Special Issue, we aim to capture state-of-the-art research papers and the most current review papers focusing on 3D printing for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In particular, we seek novel studies on the development of 3D printing and bioprinting approaches, developing printable materials (inks and bioinks), and utilizing 3D-printed scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. These applications are not limited to but include scaffolds for in vivo tissue regeneration and tissue analogues for in vitro disease modeling and/or drug screening.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-05-01T15:28:07Z (GMT).

Their high biocompatibility and ability to provide adequate regenerative support are fundamental for the development of new therapeutic devices. In particular, biomaterials derived from living organisms can exhibit not only structural roles but also several non-structural functions implicated in cellular growth, migration, and differentiation. Among them, type I collagen, a ubiquitous structural protein present in the mammalian body, plays a dominant role in maintaining the biological and structural integrity of various tissues. In recent years, with the goal of developing multi-functional collagen-based devices able to better promote the functional recovery of damaged tissues, numerous studies have focused on novel techniques and methods for the development and characterization of innovative and advanced high-performance formulations. The ability to control, modify, and tune collagen-based biomaterials performance by optimizing their architecture, besides modifying their chemistry, blending with other materials/therapeutics, or developing stimuli-responsive formulations, is an extremely important knowledge to acquire when specific multi-functionalities are sought.The present Special Issue collected 12 peer-reviewed interdisciplinary contributions on the broad topic of multi-functional collagen-based biomaterials.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-04-05T12:59:39Z (GMT).

Each one of us has likely had the experience of visting a dentist’s office, where a number of biomaterials are used temporarily or permanently in the mouth. Devices that are more complex are used for to support, heal, or replace living tissues or organs in the body that are suffering or compromised by different conditions. The materials used in their construction are metals and metallic alloys, polymers—ranging from elastomers to adhesives—and ceramics.Within these three cases, there are materials that are inert in the living environment, that perform an active function, or that are dissolved and resorbed by the metabolic pathways. Biomaterials are the outcome of a dynamic field of research that is driven by a growing demand and by the competition among the manufacturers of medical devices, with innovations improving the performance of existing devices and that contribute to the development of new ones. The collection of papers forming this volume have one particular class of of biomaterial in common, ceramic (bioceramic) composites, which as so far been used in applications such as orthopaedic joint replacement as well as in dental implants and restorations and that is being intensively investigated for bone regeneration applications. Today’s bioceramic composites (alumina–zirconia) are the golden standard in joint replacements. Several manufracturers have proposed different zirconia–alumina composites for use in hip, knee, and shoulder joint replacements, with several other innovative devices also being under study. In addition, bioceramic composites with innovative compositions are under development and will be on the market in years to come. Something that is especially interesting is the application of bioceramic composites in the regeneration of bone tissues. Research has devoted special attention to the doping of well-known materials (i.e., calcium phosphates and silicates) with bioactive ions, aiming to enhance the osteogenic ability and bioresorbability of man-made grafts. Moreover, high expectations rely on hybrid biopolymer/ceramic materials that mimic the complex composition and multiscale structure of bone tissue.","Made available in DSpace on 2022-05-06T11:22:46Z (GMT).

Such models are becoming quite popular within the bioengineering community; thus, many technologies are being tested to obtain the best scaffold for each tumor. In any case, only a tight interaction of bioengineers with cancer biologists and oncologists can make such 3D models progress, with them finally reaching a clinical relevance. On the other hand, the medical community is approaching simpler 3D in vitro models not provided with sufficient extracellular matrix biomimicry, such as spheroids and organoids, which may not be self-exhaustive; therefore, cancer researchers could benefit from closer contact with bioengineers. The aim of this reprint is to help generate shared knowledge and promote strong interdisciplinary collaboration with the ultimate goal of contributing to the acceleration of the discovery and validation of more precise therapies to fight cancer.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-04-05T12:56:59Z (GMT).

Particularly, collagen-based biomaterials have been extensively applied in various biomedical fields, such as scaffolds in tissue engineering. However, there are many challenges associated with the use of mammalian collagen, including the issues of religious constrains, allergic or autoimmune reactions, and the spread of animal diseases. Over the past few decades, marine collagen (MC) has emerged as a promising biomaterial for biomedical and pharmacological applications. Marine organisms are a rich source of structurally novel and biologically active compounds, and to date, many biological components have been isolated from various marine resources. MC offers advantages over mammalian collagen due to its water solubility, low immunogenicity, safety, biocompatibility, antimicrobial activity, functionality, and low production costs. Due to its characteristics and physicobiochemical properties, it has tremendous potential for use as a scaffold biomaterial in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, in drug delivery systems, and as a therapeutic. In this Special Issue, we encourage submissions related to the recent developments, advancements, trends, challenges, and future perspectives in this new research field. We expect to receive contributions from different areas of multidisciplinary research, including—but not restricted to—extraction, purification, characterization, fabrication, and experimentation of MC, with a particular focus on their biotechnological, biomedical and pharmacological uses.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-02-02T16:42:02Z (GMT).

Moreover, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) can be applied to generate functionally maturated liver and bile duct epithelial cells.In this Special Issue, we welcome reviews and original papers focussing on hepatic cell sources, including adult hepatic stem cells, organoids, fetal and induced pluripotent stem cells, and primary cells (i.e., hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and endothelial cells) and how these cells can be applied in tissue engineering strategies to generate implantable and personalized liver grafts. Potential topics include, but are not limited to, the following: liver tissue engineering, liver regeneration, graft repair, liver stem cells and organoids, bio-scaffolds, and 3D printing.We invite you to contribute original research papers, as well as comprehensive reviews, aligned with these themes, to advance and improve the actual state-of-the-art in liver bioengineering and providing new opportunities for the imminent medical problem of organ and tissue shortage for transplantation.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-02-11T09:07:53Z (GMT).

That is why cartilage repair remains one of the most challenging issues of musculoskeletal medicine. Arthroscopic and open techniques that have been developed over the last two decades intend to promote the success of complete repair of the articular cartilage defects; nevertheless, these therapies cannot always offer 100% success. Nowadays, cartilage tissue engineering is an emerging technique for the regeneration of cartilage tissue. Taking into consideration these perspectives, this book aims to present a summary of cartilage tissue engineering, including development, recent progress, and major steps taken toward the regeneration of functional cartilage tissue. Special emphasis is placed on the role of stimulating factors, including growth factors, gene therapies, as well as scaffolds, including natural, synthetic, and nanostructured.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-12-01T18:20:25Z (GMT).

This includes new implant designs and materials, bearings concepts and tribology, kinematical concepts, surgical techniques, and anti-inflammatory and infection prevention strategies. A careful evaluation of new materials and concepts is required in order to fully assess the strengths and weaknesses and to improve the quality and outcomes of joint replacements. Therefore, extensive research and clinical trials are essential. The main aspects that are addressed in this Special Issue are related to new material, design and manufacturing considerations of implants, implant wear and its potential clinical consequence, implant fixation, infection-related material aspects, and taper-related research topics.

Biomechanical measurement methods enable the quantitative determination of these influences and allow for an assessment of their extent and size for the patient (in vivo). The range of examination methods is particularly wide in this field of musculoskeletal research. On the one hand, in vitro examinations under laboratory conditions on simplified models, such as artificial bones or specimens from donors, will be implemented. With the help of these models, for example, new biomaterials or implants for the treatment of fractures are often examined for their primary stability or the influence of a joint replacement on the kinematics. In contrast to experimental in vitro studies, numerical methods will be increasingly applied to analyze a large number of implant configurations and loading scenarios. With the method of clinical motion analysis, a comprehensive view of the musculoskeletal system is performed directly in vivo on the patient. For example, it allows for the monitoring and control of therapeutic interventions. These are just a few examples from the field of musculoskeletal research and its methods. They all have the common goal of increasing patient safety. This Special Issue intends to provide the reader with an exciting overview of current research in the field of biomechanical investigations for the treatment of musculoskeletal diseases.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-03-07T16:35:50Z (GMT).

The essence of biomedical materials is their constant contact with living tissues, organisms, or microorganisms and, therefore, they should meet numerous requirements from various fields, including medicine, biology, chemistry, tissue engineering, and materials science. For this reason, biomaterials must be compatible with the organism, and biocompatibility issues must be addressed before using the product in a clinical setting. The production and synthesis of biomaterials require the use of various technologies and methods to obtain the appropriate material, which is then processed using advanced material processing technologies. Often, however, it is necessary to directly manufacture a specific product with individualized geometric features and properties tailored to the requirements of a particular patient. In such cases, additive manufacturing methods are increasingly used. In this sense, it can be considered that the Biomaterials 4.0 stage has been reached, and detailed information is included in the individual chapters of this book on the achievements in the development and manufacturing of modern biomaterials used in modern regenerative medicine, regenerative dentistry, and tissue engineering.","Made available in DSpace on 2022-01-11T13:52:41Z (GMT).

Metallic bio-materials with excellent mechanical strength can effectively support and replace damaged tissue. Hence, metals have been widely used in load-bearing applications for dentistry and orthopedics. Cobalt-, iron-, and titanium (Ti)-based alloys are representative bio-metals, which are used in various forms, such as vascular stents, hip joints, dental, and orthopedic implants. However, the alloying elements of Co- and Fe-based alloys, Co, Ni, and Cr, induce severe toxicity when ionized in the body, which limits their clinical use. However, Ti and its alloys have been widely used as medical devices and implants, with dental and orthopedic applications due to their excellent bone-regeneration ability, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance. Even though Ti and its alloys have generally been used for biomedical applications, there are still challenges that must be met to satisfy their clinical application. For example, osseointegration with the surrounding bone tissue at the initial stage of implantation has been pointed to as a major issue. This Special Issue, “Titanium and Its Alloys for Biomedical Applications”, has been proposed to present recent developments in biomedical applications. The nine research articles included in this Special Issue cover broad aspects of Ti-based alloys and composites with respect to their composition, mechanical, and biological properties, as highlighted in this editorial.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-02-20T16:44:43Z (GMT).

Biomaterials should be biocompatible to minimise toxicity and bioactivity to ensure or simulate biological effects. They are used, for instance, to enhance antibacterial activity and improve the healing process. Calcium silicates, for illustration, are biomaterials used in endodontics that have proven their excellent biological, physico-chemical, and mechanical properties. However, some of these are considered too soluble, and this is almost completely due to their hardness when used as endodontic sealers, making endodontic retreatment very difficult. Despite manufacturers' best efforts, it is sometimes difficult to marry bioactivity, biocompatibility, and clinical benefits in a biomaterial; therefore, in this content, the work of researchers is invaluable.","Made available in DSpace on 2024-01-08T14:47:59Z (GMT).

The gelation process occurs in response to a physical or chemical stimulus, such as temperature, pH, electric or magnetic field, enzymatic modification, light, and others. Consisting of mainly water molecules, they represent a unique class of materials, with many applications such as cell therapeutics, cartilage/bone regeneration, sustained drug release and drug delivery systems, tissue engineering, and 3D bioprinting. Despite these great strides, there is still much more to discover in this area. This Special Issue is focused on the use of hydrogels in tissue and bone regeneration. Hydrogels are particularly suited for this purpose as their physical characteristics resemble that of the extracellular matrix; as such, they have found applications as an extracellular medium for cancer cells, stem cells, and neuronal cells. This Special Issue also includes research papers on the other biomedical applications of hydrogels.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-05-11T17:16:29Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The focus lies on the production of durable implants and bone substitutes capable of bypassing complications associated with rejection. HA is a well-known bioceramic with a close chemical and structural resemblance to the mineral composition of vertebrate bones and teeth. Despite its favorable bone regeneration properties, HA is prone to brittleness, limiting its use in load-bearing applications. To overcome this drawback, HA can be applied as a coating on metallic or polymeric implants, with the aim of significantly enhancing their overall performance. Synthetic HA is typically produced by means of several chemical routes. Recent approaches have been reported for extracting HA from natural and sustainable resources. Biologically derived apatite is a carbonated HA, which differs from synthetic HA in terms of composition, stoichiometry, crystallinity degree, crystal size/morphology, and consequently, degradation rate and overall biological performance. This reprint is devoted to the synthesis and characterization techniques of HA-based coatings. The Special Issue’s scope includes both synthetic and naturally derived HA materials. Notably, significant attention was directed toward the development of bioactive and biodegradable HA-based biomaterials with tunable properties. These biomaterials are specifically designed for a range of applications, including bone repair and regeneration, tissue engineering, orthopedics, biosensing, dental implants, and in vivo testing.","Made available in DSpace on 2024-05-14T14:23:35Z (GMT).

These intend to offer not only regeneration, but complete functional recovery of diseased tissues and organs using different strategies. Gene therapy, cell therapy and tissue engineering are the main areas in which promising advanced therapies are emerging. The eye is a very complex organ whose main structures, the cornea and the retina, play a pivotal role in maintaining normal vision, as severe alterations in these tissues can lead to blindness. Ocular tissues are starting to benefit from ATMPs by fighting against the enormous complexity and devastating potential of many ocular diseases. However, developments arising from this field of work face important challenges related to vectors to deliver drugs and genetic material to target tissues, suitable biomaterials to prepare cell scaffolds and cell stemness, among others—not to mention the complicated legislation around ATMPs, the complexity in production and quality control and the absence of standardized protocols.The purpose of this Special Issue is to serve as an overview of the current progress in the application of cell and gene therapies, as well as tissue engineering to restore functionality in diseased ocular structures, and the challenges linked to reaching patients.","Made available in DSpace on 2022-01-11T13:53:06Z (GMT).

And a promising way to perform surface modifications without altering the bulk properties is plasma polymerization since this technique is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of materials. Plasma polymer films usually show good biocompatibility when compared to classical biomaterials. The possible biomedical use of plasma polymers motivates the study of their behavior during storage and in aqueous environment. Therefore, it is of major importance to understand the change of properties of these plasma polymers over time and when in contact with certain fluids. Recently, plasma polymer gradients (surfaces that display a change in at least one physicochemical property over distance) have attracted significant attention from the biomedical filed where the interaction of cells with a material surface is of major interest. This chapter discusses biomaterial functionalization via plasma polymerization focusing on their use in the biomedical field as well as their aging and stability behaviors. Plasma polymer gradients as valuable tools to investigate cell-surface interactions will also be reviewed.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-06-03T02:06:53Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The structure of viruses consists of two main parts: the genetic material from either DNA or RNA that carries genetic information, and a protein coat, called the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material. By inserting the gene encoding functional proteins into the viral genome, the functional proteins can be genetically displayed on the protein coat to form bioengineered viruses. Therefore, viruses can be considered biological nanoparticles with genetically tunable surface chemistry and can serve as models for developing virus-like nanoparticles and even nanostructures. Via this process of viral display, bioengineered viruses can be mass-produced with lower cost and potentially used for energy and biomedical applications. This book highlights the recent developments and future directions of virus-based nanomaterials and nanostructures. The virus-based biomimetic materials formulated using innovative ideas were characterized for the applications of biosensors and nanocarriers. The research contributions and trends on virus-based materials covering energy harvesting devices to tissue regeneration in the last two decades are discussed.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-05-01T15:26:41Z (GMT).

The roles of bioresorbable polymers, as a scaffold, are not merely structural, providing three-dimensional (3D) homing sites to cells, but also functional at their interface with the cells. The polymeric scaffolds actively act as both biochemical and physical cues for cell behaviors, such as adhesion, growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Polymers and cells could interact further with each other mutually, sensing and responding to the signals from the partner. Technological advances in this direction, including chemical modification of polymer scaffolds, highly cytocompatible hybrid materials/composites, dynamic scaffolds, control of juxtacrine interactions, and 3D bioprinting and microfluidic devices, ensure the advances in polymers as cell scaffolds. The detection and characterization methods for cell-material interactions and cell behaviors have been greatly improved, and new characterization techniques have emerged. Recent years have witnessed a quantum leap of progress in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and this edited book illustrates some of the advances in polymers as cell scaffolds.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-02-11T07:45:22Z (GMT).

Despite continuous refinement of microsurgery techniques, peripheral nerve repair still stands as one of the most challenging tasks in neurosurgery, as functional neuromuscular recovery is rarely satisfactory in these patients. Therefore, the improvement of surgical techniques and the clinical application of innovative therapies have been intensively studied worldwide. Direct nerve repair with epineural end-to-end sutures is still the gold standard treatment for severe neurotmesis injuries but only in cases where well-vascularized tension-free coaptation can be achieved. When peripheral nerve injury originates a significant gap between the nerve stumps, nerve grafts are required, with several associated disadvantages. Therefore, the development of scaffolds by tissue engineering can provide efficient treatment alternatives to stimulate optimum clinical outcome. Nerve conduit tailoring involves reaching ideal wall pores, using electrospinning techniques in their fabrication, surface coating with extracellular matrix materials, and adding of growth factors or cell-based therapies, among other possibilities. Also, intraluminal cues are employed such as the filling with hydrogels, inner surface modification, topographical design, and the introduction of neurotrophic factors, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and other pharmacological agents. A comprehensive state of the art of surgical techniques, tissue-engineered nerve graft scaffolds, and their application in nerve regeneration, the advances in peripheral nerve repair and future perspectives will be discussed, including surgeons' and researchers' own large experience in this field of knowledge.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-12-01T15:31:16Z (GMT).

It is the study of nature and natural phenomena in an attempt to understand its laws, principles, and underlying mechanisms, to obtain ideas from nature, and to apply concepts that may benefit science, engineering, pharmacy, dentistry, and medicine. Smart/intelligent biomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine are fine examples of biomimetics. Yet, biomimicry can go above and beyond the simplistic inspiration and use of natural properties as the basis for the innovation of new products. It bridges the gap between the lab and the industry via the intra-disciplinary design and formulation of functional solutions combining knowledge, methods, techniques, and advances in the fields of chemistry, biology, architecture, engineering, medicine, pharmaceutics, dentistry, and biomedical engineering. Three-dimensional printing, self-healing nanocoatings, hydrogels, bio-mechanical carbon nanotubes, stimuli-sensitive and -responsive cell/drug delivery systems, and robotics are some of the topics covered in this book. In a simplified style, the book provides interested readers with a practical reference approaching biomimetics and biomimicry from a realistic and translational perspective, discussing problems and offering solutions and including studies ranging from basics to the clinic to scale-up and industrial or go-to-market obstacles. Through Biomimetics - Bridging the Gap, you’ll quickly discover that biomimicry is more than just looking at a silkworm (silk is one of the first examples in history) or at the shape of a flower, a damselfly, or even a humpback whale and becoming re-inspired. Biomimicry is an intra-/multi-disciplinary methodology and technological-oriented approach presently employed by the most innovative organizations on this planet.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-02-15T14:58:45Z (GMT).

Physical, chemical, or electrical signals from the neighboring cells or biochemical signals from distant cells are crucial in the cell fate decision process. A major challenge of tissue engineering is to mimic the natural cell environment by designing very sophisticated scaffolds able not only to mechanically support cells, but also to release signals biologically relevant for governing stem cell fate. In addition, increasing evidence suggests that abnormal interaction of stem cells with their niche is responsible for altered cell function leading to malignant transformation. This book discusses some of the recent advances in stem cell research that may help understanding the properties of the niche that govern stem cell fate. Technical topics discussed include:Stem cell biologyCancer stem cellsStem cell interactions with biomaterialsEngineering the stem cell microenvironmentStem cells in tissue regeneration and repairThe Disputationes Workshop series is an international initiative aimed at disseminating stem cell related cutting edge knowledge among scientists, healthcare workers, students and policy makers. This book emerges as a result of the scientific contributions presented and discussed during the fifth Disputationes Workshop held in Aalborg (Denmark) in April 2014. The stem cell microenvironment and its role in regenerative medicine and cancer pathogenesis is ideal for academic staff and master/research students in biomedical and health sciences","Made available in DSpace on 2022-11-29T04:03:30Z (GMT).

In recent years, bone implants based on metals, ceramics, and polymers have been widely utilized and helped millions of patients. However, the rapid growth of the elderly demographic has tremendously intensified the occurrence of bone trauma cases, requiring once again the further development of effective strategies for bone reconstruction and regeneration. Therefore, the development of scaffolds and implants with new compositions, three-dimensional configurations, proper mechanical properties, and particular interactions with cells is highly expected. These new biomaterials may effectively promote bone regeneration and thus have a significant impact on individual patients and health care systems. In this Special Issue, we would like to present an innovative perspective on the scaffolds and implants for bone regeneration. Topics will include but not be limited to, the following: scaffold design and fabrication; biocompatibility and biodegradability; host response to implants; cell–scaffold interactions; and scaffold-based drug delivery.

Combined with a lack of solvents, preservation of the bulk properties, and fast treatment times; it is a well-liked technique for the treatment of materials for biomedical applications. In this book chapter, a review will be given on what the scientific community determined to be essential to obtain appropriate scaffolds for tissue engineering and how plasma scientists have used non-thermal plasma technology to accomplish this. A distinction will be made depending on the scaffold fabrication technique, as each technique has its own set of specific problems that need to be tackled. Fabrication techniques will include traditional fabrication methods, rapid prototyping, and electrospinning. As for the different plasma techniques, both plasma activation and grafting/polymerization will be included in the review and linked to the in-vitro/in-vivo response to these treatments. The literature review itself is preceded by a more general overview on cell communication, giving useful insights on how surface modification strategies should be developed.",Item created via OAI harvest from source: https://library.oapen.org/oai/doab-migration on 2021-11-13T05:29:25Z (GMT).

It is a primary building block of bones, tendons, skin, hair, cartilage, and all joints in the body. It is also considered a ""glue"" that holds the body together. Collagen production begins to slow down, and cell structures start losing their strength as we become older. Collagen supplementation is a vital way to help our body revive itself and stay youthful. Recently, collagen-based biomedical materials have developed important and clinically effective materials that have become widely acceptable. However, collagen extraction from land animal sources is complex, time consuming, and expensive. Hence, marine sources have started to be researched and have been found to be the most convenient and safest sources for obtaining collagen. Another reason for favouring these sources is due to concerns over adverse inflammatory and immunologic responses and the prevalence of various diseases among land animals that can cause health complications.Marine sources also have plenty of advantages over land animal sources: (1) a high collagen content; (2) environmentally friendly; (3) the presence of biological contaminants and toxins is almost negligible; (4) a low inflammatory response; (5) greater absorption due to their low molecular weight; (6) less significant religious and ethical constraints; (7) minor regulatory and quality control problems; (8) metabolic compatibility, among others. This huge source of marine collagen is expected to make a great contribution to marine biotechnology products and medical applications.","Made available in DSpace on 2022-07-06T11:51:35Z (GMT).

However, the survivorship of the implants could be adversely affected due to the loss of materials in the form of particles or ions as the bearing surfaces articulate against earch other. The consequent tissue and immune response to the wear products, remain one of the key factors of their failure. Tribology has been defined as the science and technology of interacting surfaces in relative motion and all related wear products (e.g., particles, ions, etc.). Over the last few decades, in an attempt to understand and improve joint replacement technology, the tribological performance of several material combinations have been studied experimentally and assessed clinically. In addition, research has focused on the biological effects and long term consequences of wear products. Improvements have been made in manufacturing processes, precision engineering capabilities, device designs and materials properties in order to minimize wear and friction and maximize component longevity in vivo.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-02-12T06:35:40Z (GMT).

Thanks to the application of contemporary dental materials, the effectiveness of clinical dentistry has witnessed remarkable advances. In recent years, thanks to digital technology and the frenetic development of the dental industry, new materials have been developed and proposed in each field of dentistry: prosthesis, restorative dentistry, endodontics, implantology, and orthodontics. Unfortunately, as often occurs, this productive challenge is not always accompanied by valid scientific research; consequently, the clinician finds at their disposal materials that are not necessarily better than the previous ones. Further studies are needed to gain relevant evidence for all recently introduced dental materials. This Special Issue contains high-quality research articles, clinical studies, review articles, and case reports focused on the latest advances and prospects of dental materials concerning all fields of dentistry.","Made available in DSpace on 2024-05-14T14:31:31Z (GMT).

The development of such Stem Cell therapies requires an in-depth knowledge of their identity, immune biology and technical culture and manipulation. It is also important that we understand the mechanisms regulating their maintenance, expansion and functions for issues relating to safety and efficiency. Finally, in order to improve the therapeutic use of Stem Cells within clinical practice we must characterize the micro-environment in which they exist (e.g., hypoxia), their fate and properties. By including a number of different types of manuscripts in this Special Issue, we have facilitated a discussion about recent fundamental and applied advances that will help the scientific community to develop new therapeutic strategies based on the use of Stem Cells.","Made available in DSpace on 2024-05-14T14:11:13Z (GMT).

Due to the limited regenerative capabilities of terminally differentiated cardiomyocytes post injury, new strategies to treat cardiac patients are urgently needed. Post myocardial injury, resident fibroblasts begin to generate the extracellular matrix, resulting in fibrosis, and finally, cardiac failure. Recently, preclinical investigations and clinical trials raised hope in stem cell-based approaches, to be an effective therapy option for these diseases. So far, several types of stem cells have been identified to be promising candidates to be applied for treatment: cardiac progenitor cells, bone marrow derived stem cells, embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, as well as their descendants. Furthermore, the innovative techniques of direct cardiac reprogramming of cells offered promising options for cardiovascular research, in vitro and in vivo. Hereby, the investigation of underlying and associated mechanisms triggering the therapeutic effects of stem cell application is of particular importance to improve approaches for heart patients. This Special Issue of Cells provides the latest update in the rapidly developing field of regenerative medicine in cardiology.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-05-01T15:42:17Z (GMT).

The spectrum of existing biodegradable materials is still very narrow; thus, to achieve greater applicability, research is being carried out on biodegradable polymer mixtures, the synthesis of new polymers, and the incorporation of new stabilizers for thermal degradation, alongside the use of other additives such as antibacterials or new and more sustainable plasticizers. Some studies analyze direct applications, such as shape memory foams, new cartilage implants, drug release, etc.The reader can find several studies on the degradation of biodegradable polymers under composting conditions; however, novel bacteria that degrade polymers considered non-biodegradable in other, unusual conditions (such as conditions of high salinity) are also presented.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-05-11T17:21:48Z (GMT).

GAGs are ubiquitously localized throughout the extracellular matrix (ECM) and to the cell membranes of cells in all tissues. They are either conjugated to protein cores in the form of proteoglycans, e.g., chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS), heparin/heparan sulfate (Hep/HS) and keratan sulfate (KS), as well as non-sulfated hyaluronan (HA). By modulating biological signaling GAGs participate in the regulation of homeostasis and also participate in disease progression. The book, entitled “Exploring the multifaceted roles of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)—new advances and further challenges”, features original research and review articles. These articles cover several GAG-related timely topics in structural biology and imaging; morphogenesis, cancer, and other disease therapy and drug developments; tissue engineering; and metabolic engineering. This book also includes an article illustrating how metabolic engineering can be used to create the novel chondroitin-like polysaccharide.A prerequisite for communicating in any discipline and across disciplines is familiarity with the appropriate terminology. Several nomenclature rules exist in the field of biochemistry. The historical description of GAGs follows IUPAC and IUB nomenclature. New structural depictions such as the structural nomenclature for glycan and their translation into machine-readable formats have opened the route for cross-references with popular bioinformatics resources and further connections with other exciting “omics” fields.","Made available in DSpace on 2022-01-11T13:53:43Z (GMT).

These activities are stimulated by the strengthened public awareness of prevailing ecological issues connected to growing piles of plastic waste and increasing greenhouse gas emissions; this goes hand-in-hand with the ongoing depletion of fossil feedstocks, which are traditionally used to produce full carbon backbone polymers. Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolyesters, a family of plastic-like materials with versatile material properties, are increasing considered to be a future-oriented solution for diminishing these concerns. PHA production is based on renewable resources and occurs in a bio-mediated fashion through the action of living organisms. If accomplished in an optimized way, PHA production and the entire PHA lifecycle are embedded into nature´s closed cycles of carbon. Sustainable and efficient PHA production requires understanding and improvement of all the individual process steps. Holistic improvement of PHA production, applicable on an industrially relevant scale, calls for, inter alia, consolidated knowledge about the enzymatic and genetic particularities of PHA-accumulating organisms, an in-depth understanding of the kinetics of the bioprocess, the selection of appropriate inexpensive fermentation feedstocks, tailoring of PHA composition at the level of its monomeric constituents, optimized biotechnological engineering, and novel strategies for PHA recovery from biomass characterized by low energy and chemical requirements. This Special Issue represents a comprehensive compilation of articles in which these individual aspects have been addressed by globally recognized experts.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-02-11T07:50:06Z (GMT).

It affects more than 500 million people worldwide. Patients develop osteoarthritis when the structure of the protective cartilage that covers the bones begins to deteriorate. Recent research shows that multiple drugs in development are promising to treat osteoarthritis. Yet, most physicians agree that we still do not have enough effective treatments for this condition. What works for one person might not work for someone else. Consequently, osteoarthritis research is very important because understanding what causes osteoarthritis or why it progresses remains controversial. In fact, although articular cartilage is the primary target of the disease, both subchondral bone and synovium are often actively involved. This book describes the details of both surgical and non-surgical treatment options for osteoarthritis.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-09-05T15:52:37Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

On the contrary, biopolymers and active biomolecules from biobased sources could be used to produce new materials that are highly compatible with the skin and also biodegradable. The final products can be obtained by exploiting safe and smart nanotechnologies such as the extrusion of bionanocomposites and electrospinning/electrospray, as well as innovative surface modification and control methodologies. For all these reasons, recently, many researchers, such as those involved in the European POLYBIOSKIN project activities, have been working in the field of biomaterials with anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, as well as biobased materials which are renewable and biodegradable. The present book gathered research and review papers dedicated to materials and technologies for high-performance products where the attention paid to health and environmental impact is efficiently integrated, considering both the skin-compatibility of the selected materials and their source/end of life.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-05-01T15:06:25Z (GMT).

Wound healing is a complex phenomenon through which there is healing of the skin. The wound healing process begins immediately after the wound occurs and can be a lengthy and complex process depending on the severity of the wound and the normal or abnormal healing progress. Wound healing progress through three distinct phases of inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling in a methodical and complex sequence that involves cellular, molecular, and humoral mechanisms of action. Any change in this sequence of events can lead to abnormal wound healing. Due to the health and psychological consequences of wounds that are difficult to heal there has been a continuous effort to develop new therapies that promote wound healing more quickly and effectively and that restore the skin’s barrier function. Nevertheless, this situation remains a medical challenge. This book presents some therapeutic advances based on new and innovative therapeutic options, medical devices, and biomaterials to promote wound healing. It is a theoretical and practical reference for future research on chronic wound healing.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-09-05T16:04:45Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

The biomedical application of hydrogels was initially hampered by the toxicity of cross-linking agents and the limitations of hydrogel formation under physiological conditions. However, emerging knowledge in polymer chemistry and an increased understanding of biological processes have resulted in the design of versatile materials and minimally invasive therapies.The novel but challenging properties of hydrogels are attracting the attention of researchers in the biological, medical, and pharmaceutical fields. In the last few years, new methods have been developed for the preparation of hydrophilic polymers and hydrogels, which may be used in future biomedical and drug delivery applications. Such efforts include the synthesis of self-organized nanostructures based on triblock copolymers with applications in controlled drug delivery. These hydrogels could be used as carriers for drug delivery when combined with the techniques of drug imprinting and subsequent release. Engineered protein hydrogels have many potential advantages. They are excellent biomaterials and biodegradables. Furthermore, they could encapsulate drugs and be used in injectable forms to replace surgery, to repair damaged cartilage, in regenerative medicine, or in tissue engineering. Also, they have potential applications in gene therapy, although this field is relatively new.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-12-01T18:02:58Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1

Combined with a lack of solvents, preservation of the bulk properties, and fast treatment times; it is a well-liked technique for the treatment of materials for biomedical applications. In this book chapter, a review will be given on what the scientific community determined to be essential to obtain appropriate scaffolds for tissue engineering and how plasma scientists have used non-thermal plasma technology to accomplish this. A distinction will be made depending on the scaffold fabrication technique, as each technique has its own set of specific problems that need to be tackled. Fabrication techniques will include traditional fabrication methods, rapid prototyping, and electrospinning. As for the different plasma techniques, both plasma activation and grafting/polymerization will be included in the review and linked to the in-vitro/in-vivo response to these treatments. The literature review itself is preceded by a more general overview on cell communication, giving useful insights on how surface modification strategies should be developed.",Item created via OAI harvest from source: https://library.oapen.org/oai/doab-migration on 2021-11-24T05:52:56Z (GMT).

Finally, combination products including or based on biopolymers for controlled drug release offer a powerful solution to improve the tissue integration and biological response of these materials. Understanding the drug delivery mechanisms, efficiency, and toxicity of such systems may be useful for regenerative medicine and pharmaceutical technology.

They characterize microstructures across length scales ranging from tens of nanometers to a few tens of micrometers.In this collection, X-ray CT shines a light on the mechanical properties of engineering materials, such as aluminum or magnesium alloys, stainless steel, aluminum, polymer composites, or ceramic foam. In these experiments, X-ray CT is able to image and quantify the damage occurring during tensile, compression, indentation, or fatigue tests.Of course, X-ray CT can illuminate the structure and behavior of natural materials too. Here it is applied to bone or natural snow to study their mechanical behavior, as well as materials from the agri-food sector. Its versatility is exemplified by analyses of topics as diverse as the removal of olive oil from kitchen sponges by squeezing and rinsing, to the effect of temperature changes on the structure of ice cream.","Made available in DSpace on 2021-05-01T15:26:45Z (GMT).

Part of that industry consists of textiles for medical and healthcare applications and are responsible for a continuous increase in its market potential [1]. Next to their need in hospital environments, there is a growing demand in other sectors such as the food and hotel industry, due to stricter hygiene regulations. In most cases biomedical textile meets a well-defined set of requirements such as minimizing non-specific protein adsorption, drug delivery coatings or the presence of active functional coatings and most importantly excellent biocompatibility (blood-, tissue-or cyto-compatibility) [2]. In general there are very few materials meeting all these characteristics, while at the same time offering the needed structural and mechanical properties.

The spectrum of existing biodegradable materials is still very narrow; thus, to achieve greater applicability, research is being carried out on biodegradable polymer mixtures, the synthesis of new polymers, and the incorporation of new stabilizers for thermal degradation, alongside the use of other additives such as antibacterials or new and more sustainable plasticizers. Some studies analyze direct applications, such as shape memory foams, new cartilage implants, drug release, etc.The reader can find several studies on the degradation of biodegradable polymers under composting conditions; however, novel bacteria that degrade polymers considered non-biodegradable in other, unusual conditions (such as conditions of high salinity) are also presented.","Made available in DSpace on 2023-05-11T17:21:51Z (GMT).

Just over 90 years later, plasma technology is becoming increasingly important in our daily life. For example, in the medical field and dentistry, plasma is used as a method of disinfection and sterilization. Moreover, additional potential novel applications of this technology in different forms of therapy have been proposed. In the agricultural sector, plasma technology could contribute to higher crop yields by enhancing seed germination and the growth of plants, as well as the preservation of foods by disinfection. Plasma technology could also be utilized in environmental applications, including water treatment and remediation, as well as treatment of exhaust gases. Although recent extensive studies have uncovered the broad potential of plasma technology, its mechanisms of action remain unclear. Therefore, further studies aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms of plasma technology are required. This book is composed of original articles and reviews investigating the molecular mechanisms of plasma biology. Relevant areas of study include applications in plasma medicine, plasma agriculture, as well as plasma chemistry. Studies on potential therapeutic approaches using plasma itself and plasma-treated solutions are also included.","Made available in DSpace on 2022-01-11T13:43:46Z (GMT). No. of bitstreams: 1
